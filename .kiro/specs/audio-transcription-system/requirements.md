# Requirements Document

## Introduction

An automated transcription system that processes directories of MP3 audio files containing seminars on Reams Biological Theory of Ionization (RBTI), producing rich-text transcriptions with speaker identification and specialized terminology recognition.

## Glossary

- **Transcription_System**: The automated software system that processes audio files and generates transcriptions
- **Audio_Directory**: A file system directory containing MP3 audio files to be transcribed
- **Transcription_Directory**: A file system directory created to store the output transcription files
- **Speaker_Diarization**: The process of identifying and labeling different speakers in an audio recording
- **Custom_Glossary**: A predefined list of specialized RBTI terminology to improve transcription accuracy
- **Rich_Text_Format**: A formatted text output that includes speaker labels, timestamps, and proper formatting
- **RBTI**: Reams Biological Theory of Ionization - the specialized subject matter of the audio content

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to process a directory of MP3 files automatically, so that I can transcribe multiple seminar recordings without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Transcription_System receives an Audio_Directory path, THE Transcription_System SHALL validate that the directory exists and contains MP3 files
2. THE Transcription_System SHALL process all MP3 files found in the specified Audio_Directory
3. THE Transcription_System SHALL create a "transcription" subdirectory within the Audio_Directory if it does not exist
4. THE Transcription_System SHALL generate one transcription file for each MP3 file processed
5. THE Transcription_System SHALL preserve the original filename in the transcription output filename with appropriate extension change

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want speaker identification in my transcriptions, so that I can distinguish between different speakers in multi-person seminars.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Transcription_System SHALL perform Speaker_Diarization on each audio file during processing
2. THE Transcription_System SHALL assign consistent speaker labels throughout each individual transcription
3. THE Transcription_System SHALL include speaker identification markers in the Rich_Text_Format output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher working with specialized RBTI terminology, I want accurate transcription of technical terms, so that the transcriptions maintain scientific accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Transcription_System SHALL utilize a Custom_Glossary containing RBTI-specific terminology
2. THE Transcription_System SHALL apply the Custom_Glossary during the transcription process to improve accuracy
3. THE Transcription_System SHALL maintain a configurable glossary that can be updated with additional terms
4. THE Transcription_System SHALL limit custom glossary to a maximum of 1,000 terms to ensure compatibility across all supported transcription services
5. THE Transcription_System SHALL prioritize glossary terms over generic transcription alternatives
6. THE Transcription_System SHALL handle human health, animal husbandry and agriculture terminology within the same glossary

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want rich-text formatted transcriptions, so that I can easily read and reference the content with proper structure and speaker attribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Transcription_System SHALL output transcriptions in Rich_Text_Format with clear speaker labels
2. THE Transcription_System SHALL include timestamp markers at regular intervals throughout the transcription
3. THE Transcription_System SHALL format speaker changes with clear visual separation
4. THE Transcription_System SHALL preserve paragraph structure and natural speech breaks
5. THE Transcription_System SHALL save transcription files in a widely compatible rich-text format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want reliable error handling and progress tracking, so that I can monitor the transcription process and handle any issues that arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MP3 file cannot be processed, THE Transcription_System SHALL log the error and terminate processing immediately
2. THE Transcription_System SHALL provide progress indicators showing current file being processed and completion status
3. THE Transcription_System SHALL generate a summary report of successful and failed transcriptions
4. IF a transcription service is unavailable, THEN THE Transcription_System SHALL provide clear error messages and terminate processing
5. THE Transcription_System SHALL validate audio file format and quality before attempting transcription
6. WHEN resuming transcription processing, THE Transcription_System SHALL skip files that already have corresponding transcription files and continue from the first untranscribed file

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want multiple output formats and caching capabilities, so that I can choose the best format for my needs and reformat transcriptions without re-processing audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Transcription_System SHALL output transcriptions in both HTML and Markdown formats by default
2. THE Transcription_System SHALL allow users to specify output format as HTML only, Markdown only, or both
3. THE Transcription_System SHALL cache raw transcription service responses in JSON format for each processed file
4. THE Transcription_System SHALL provide a format-only mode that regenerates HTML and Markdown files from cached responses
5. WHEN running in format-only mode, THE Transcription_System SHALL skip audio processing and use only cached service responses
6. THE Transcription_System SHALL organize output files in separate subdirectories for HTML, Markdown, cache, and metadata
