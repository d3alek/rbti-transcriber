In putting these notes together, all parts of the Reams' Biological Theory of Ionization Course 
lectures have been used including: 
 daily devotions, 
 lecture material, 
 questions and answers,  
 stories, and 
 jokes 
 
because they all help to explain either the RBTI or the man, Carey "Doc" Reams.  Also note that, 
in the main, Australian spelling conventions apply. 
 
The sources for these notes are: 
 Class 1 – Series 876D 
 Class 2 – Series 877CA2 
 Class 3 – Series 177-3 
 Class 3-4 Series 677, and 
 Class 5 – Series 877 
 
In studying these notes , please note that "Doc" Reams expected his students to use their brains, 
and think, and he used the following methods to pass information: 
 
 Lecture Style, i.e. he would tell the class the direct information. 
 Story.  He would tell a story to illustrate his point. 
 Parable.  He would tell a parable to illustrate his point. 
 Hint.  He would sometimes hint that there was more to follow. 
 
In view of his use of all these methods all available information from the course has been 
presented here in summary and, as far as possible, the wording and explanations are his.  In some 
cases small liberties have been taken to make the text more readable and more easily understood  
while at the same time retaining the meaning. 
 
Throughout the book I have attempted at all times to maintain three things: 
1. To keep it as accurate as possible to the lectures, 
2. To make it readable, and 
3. To facilitate finding information. 
 
In respect of point 3 above, there has been a lot of duplication and repetition of  material in order 
to present it in its topic categories and to make it easy to find specific information. 
 
In regard to the  practising of dietary planning and advice by RBTI, be aware that various legal 
things are mentioned as being allowed, or requiring special permits or some other such thing.  Be 
aware that these notes were ORIGINALLY set down in the mid -70's, and in the United States of 
America.  In the intervening period of time laws may have changed, so it is the responsibility of 
the individual, in whatever country, to become thoroughly fami liar with all the relevant legal 
aspects that may affect a nutritional consultancy practice.

A word of caution to the wise.  W hile I endeavored to make the se notes as accurate as possible, 
they should be considered a BASIC , introductory text only.   My interpretation, based on my 
understanding and knowledge, may be slightly off and therefore I’ll continue to review and 
revise these notes.  You are encouraged to do the same.   
 
Carey Reams always planned to teach his Theory of Ionization in 9 Sessions , and I know t here 
have been further developments, and more advanced classes are being taught.   However, 
information from later than Session 5 will not be included here; that is the province of the current 
RBTI teachers. 
 
The serious student is encouraged to enroll in those classes to further their own knowledge and 
understanding, clarify and correct misinformation, and pickup where these notes leave off. 
 
 
THE REAMS' BIOLOGICAL THEORY OF IONIZATION 
 
 
General Introduction 
 
 
The Reams' Biological Theory of Ionization (RBTI) is about how the body is put together and how it is taken apart.  
The equation for perfect health is central to RBTI as it provides a simple method of analyzing one person’s body 
chemistry; assessing the loss or gain of energy and most importantly of all, providing a signpost for diet and lifestyle

changes to correct that loss of energy.  If the body is gaining energy then it's getting well, whereas if it's losing 
energy it's in decline.  Perfect health has 100% reserve energy and “0” reserve energy is death. 
 
The equation was developed for the sole purpose of designing a diet to suit a single person’s individual body 
chemistry, but as a spoon can be used for things other than eating, so the equation too can be used for other things, 
but dietary planning and guidance is its main purpose. 
 
The equation and methods used in the RBTI were originally devised by Carey Reams in about 1931 from a number 
of different sources, including the sciences, ma thematics and his own original research in the realms of physics, 
chemistry and biology, all tied together with calculus and relative math. 
 
Carey Reams was born with an insatiable curiosity to know the "WHY" of everything.  In his own words:  
"When I was a small boy my nickname was 'Question Box', and the whole community knew me as 'Question 
Box', and it's still 'Question Box' today.  I still want to know the answer. 
 
I had questions for everybody all the time and the only strange thing about it is, I remem bered the answers, 
and how wrong I found some of the answers in later life and many times I also found out those that were wise 
enough when I asked a question to say, "I don't know."  I also found out others would say, "well that's the 
way my daddy did it, and that's the way my grand daddy did it, so that's the way I'm going to do it."  In other 
words they were just living robots." 
 
Although reluctant to discuss his educational past, my understanding is that Carey Reams studied Science at Oxford 
University, from which institution he obtained his Doctorate in Science.  His Doctorate, his intimate knowledge of 
anatomy and physiology, are presumed to be the reasons his students affectionately referred to him as "Doc".  
 
In his studies and research, as well as hi s seminars, while he communicated physically in English, he actually 
thought and reasoned in the language of mathematics.  Paraphrasing his words, he put it this way, “in order to work 
out the perfect pattern according to the frequency you need to use adva nced calculus and relative math, and it also 
depends on how far you go, for instance, if you go far enough in advanced calculus you've got Euclid and Enid:  
 Euclid Math (from Euclidean Theory) is the picture (which goes back to the geometrical patterns that  
architects use to draw the blue print of the building, or the bridge, or the railroad, or the mechanical 
engineer draws to whatever he wants the shop to build), and 
 Enid Math is what makes math become a language, in other words it's a language in which you can 
converse and convey ideas and thoughts 
 
and then after you do that you're in relativity.  The solid geometry is the door that opens the door to relativity.  When 
you get to Enid in calculus you come to a place that there's nowhere else to go except  to go in circles, and then 
you’re in relative math, and in relative math the rules are entirely different, for instance, in geometrical math parallel 
lines never meet, but in relative math they must cross at least twice, and may cross many more times than  that.  Now 
if that were not true there would be no such thing as matter or substance.” 
 
Of his students, to most questions he asked he required a mathematically provable answer.  To "Doc", things had to 
make sense and be provable in math before he accepted an answer. 
 
In his quest for knowledge he found many things that were taught in schools and colleges were not only 
scientifically inaccurate in detail, but that to most people the details did not matter.  For instance, most people do not 
need to know the  ionic composition, or even energy levels, in one atom, but Carey Reams did, and in order to 
overcome the problems and inadequacies he found in the text books, he: 
 studied with private tutors, 
 conducted his own, original research, 
 researched and developed his own scientific theories, and 
 modified his understanding of chemistry to better reflect both the known laws and his own experimental 
results. 
 
His work ethic and  principles were such that he constantly sought truth based strictly on mathematical principles, 
not on a perceived truth, not on a generally acceptable truth, not on a financially beneficial truth, and not on a

convenient theory.  Needless to say, his the ories and teachings often went against the grain of current teaching but 
that does not make them incorrect, only exceedingly unpopular with those who teach the orthodox way for to accept 
his changes put them on the bottom of the ladder again.. 
 
In order to  begin to get his message across to his students, many of them health professionals with medical and 
chiropractic degrees, they often had to "unlearn" what they had learnt at school, in college and in medical school for 
not only did he show them that chemi stry and physics were being taught incorrectly; but that anatomy and 
physiology also were being taught incorrectly to Doctors in medical school as well.  Carey Reams made himself 
exceedingly unpopular with many people in the orthodox establishment because he questioned their beliefs, 
principles and teachings AND FOUND THEM WANTING.  However, instead of criticizing where he found error, 
he taught and explained to those who would listen and learn.  He loved skeptics and was often heard to say to his 
students "the more skeptical you are during these Courses the more benefit you're going to get out of it because a 
person that comes ready to swallow this teaching hook, line and sinker misses about half of it, but the skeptic picks 
the bones and gets the meat.  So I love skeptics, they're the ones that really go out and do something about it because 
they've found a new toy [that] they can use to help people." 
 
One medical doctor from California said to him, "I came as a skeptic to these Courses, and I was going to prove you 
a charlatan and wrong, so I wrote down everything you said that was contrary to what I was taught and what I 
believe, and for a whole month I've been trying to prove you wrong and I found you right 100% of the time.  I now 
come to you and want to ask you to forgive me for thinking that I was a doubting Thomas." 
 
Carey Reams also used to say to his students, "I want you to check out everything I say.  You don't have to take a 
thing in the world I say as hook, line and sinker, or swallow it at all.  Take what I say, use it, prove it beyond a 
shadow of a doubt, and then it will become a part of you and you a part of it."  
 
So what did Carey Reams do? 
 
Carey Reams used his knowledge of physics, math, chemistry, anatomy, physiology and biophysics to deve lop an 
equation which was a signpost of health.  The equation expresses every possible degree of human health within the 
range of "death through 'perfect health' to death".  Remember this; the equation is just a signpost that shows:  
 How far away from perfect health a person is. 
 The direction that is needed for a person to gain perfect health. 
 Whether the body is cooperating or not. 
 Whether the body is getting well or not. 
 
Not only did he develop the equation, but he also tested and researched foods and foo d chemistry to measure their 
effects on the body chemistry.  He had to formulate and prove theories, research the foods, the sciences and make 
definitions in areas where there was either no information, or incorrect information.  
 
His frequently stated maxim was that the equation was a way of formulating a better diet for ONE person. 
 
While the equation itself is NOT one of the healing arts, it is the greatest tool the healing arts ever had for not only 
does it show what healing methods work, but perhaps more importantly, it shows what methods DON'T WORK. 
 
Running through his entire work is his devotion to his religion and his love of God, and in all aspects he found that 
his scientific knowledge and mathematical work reinforced and strengthened his belief in  God and explained many 
otherwise inexplicable parts of the Bible. 
 
Early in his life's work he realized he was able to trace its beginnings to a specific incident that occurred while he 
was a child.  In his own words he said, 
"My work probably started whe n I was five years old.  The first memory that I have of connecting any 
thoughts with this started when I was five years old and I didn't realize at that moment at all, by any means, 
that it would have any bearing upon my entire life, but I asked one quest ion then that was a key, that gave an 
indication that my life had already been patterned, I was five years old.  We belonged to a country church and 
we had a circuit riding minister that came around once a month and this particular Sunday was the first 
message that I ever remember hearing preached, I still remember the message to this day, and the message

that he preached was on the resurrection of the dead.  He went home with my parents that day and while we 
were having dinner I said to him, "Brother Smith , I don't believe what you said in your sermon today." I was 
only five years old.  I saw my parents' faces cloud up, I still remember something was going on but I didn't 
know what it was, I was too young to know, but I knew when they frowned I did somethin g that I shouldn't 
have done, and this man of God said, "Well son, what did I say that you didn't understand?"  
I said, "You said in your sermon today that when Jesus comes the dead were going to get up and go to meet 
him in the air, and don't you know when  something dies it goes back to dust again and you can't put it 
together again." 
and he said, "Well son, who put you together to start with?" 
I said, "Nobody, the doctor brought me."  Just a child understanding in a childish way.  
He said, "Well you're only a child now, but when you're a man you'll understand these things."  
 
Well curious to say that when I became a man I became more confused about God putting things together 
again;  the martyrs burned at the stake; the saints buried at sea; people that were torn asunder by explosions.  
Why, I only became more confused.  The gases from the brain and body scattering out over the ocean, being 
brought down in the rain, falling down into the ocean, eaten by the plankton, and the bigger fish eating the 
plankton, an d man catching the fish and scattering them over the earth.  I really became confused.  My 
problem was I was trying to bring God down to my size. 
 
I'd been in practice a few years, 4 or 5 years, when two police officers brought some ashes into my laborator y 
and said, "Can you tell us whether or not these are animal or people that burned in this building?"  
I said, "I don't know, but I'll try."  Little did I dream then, practically 35 years later I guess, that the question 
that I asked at 5 years old would be answered. 
 
Now the undertaker had been a good friend of ours since I was a child, he hunted and fished with my father.  
He was somewhat older than I was, his name was Carey Hand, and I went to him and I said to Mr Hand, 
"could I borrow some ashes of crema ted people for some research work in my lab?"  And I told him what my 
problem was with the police.  I said, "I will not take any of it, use it or abuse it, I will return to you all the 
ashes, dehydrated in the same form that you give them to me.  I do not need them, all I need to know is the 
ionization of them." 
and he said, "certainly." 
In two weeks I had gone through quite a group of ashes in which I had known the sex, age, height, weight, 
race, creed, colour and so forth, and I was able to distinguish th em and to come in on the frequency, and as 
far as I know this was the discovery of frequency for human beings.  Now Doctor Northcott in Germany 
discovered the frequency of grapes, and he was the one who taught me what the frequency of grapes was, but 
I was the one who discovered the frequency of human beings. 
 
Then I gave the report to the police.  There was not one person there that burned, there was three.  There were 
two females and one male; and this was done by the frequency of the ashes.  I could not tell anything about 
their ages, but there was a mother and her two children, a boy and a girl, that had burned and had been 
missing since that day, and they evidently crowded into a closet when they couldn't get out and they burned 
together in that buildin g.  So I used that until I went to war, World War II, and at that time I gave it to the 
police department.  It's still in use to this day as far as I know.  By the ashes we can tell everything except the 
age, the age has to be measured in thousands and we cannot measure it delicately enough. 
 
Then the question that I had asked at five years old became clear, because in the Book of Revelations it says 
this, "When the books are opened and your name is called you shall answer", but another translation says 
this, "When the books are opened and your number is called you will come as needles to the pole".  When 
Jesus calls your number you will come.  So you hear people say today, "I've got your number."  We are 
numbers, and God knows our number, and we cannot hide  from God, He knows where we are.  Regardless of 
what happens to us this is the foundation in the Scriptures verifying the very thing that I'm going to teach you 
in this class.  It's in the bible, and it's clear, and it will come out more and more all thro ugh this course.  I 
believe that all of the healing arts are religions and no-one has a right to say the others cannot exist, and in the 
healing arts we have just like preachers, some good preachers, some poor, some good doctors, some poor 
doctors, just the way it is in life."

Through his research with the ashes Carey Reams was able to determine the specific identifiers of the human body:  
 frequency, 
 micronage, 
 milli micronage, and 
 milli milli micronage. 
 
yet there still remained another trigger which was to cause him to actually develop his equation. 
 
In his own words: 
"I'll tell you how this equation came into existence.  I was a young engineer and as far as I know, I had the 
first medical laboratory in the South Eastern part of the United States.  Fifty years ago (about 1925) doctors 
did not know anything about blood chemistry or body chemistry or anything, and while I was still in college I 
opened a medical laboratory to begin to show doctors some of the things that were being taught the students 
in the pre-med courses.  So the doctors didn't pay much attention to it but they liked that kid, they wanted to 
help him get through college so they sent people to him and this is what they said, "I want to help that kid get 
through college" and they sent people to me to be tested and I sent the doctors the report. 
 
I started a rapport with the doctors that kept up until 1968, and I was doing work in the three largest hospitals 
in the Orlando area for 38 years when I was arrested for practicing medicine without a license, doing the 
work for doctors, at doctor's request and no -one else.  And in this 38 years they never found this system 
wrong once, not once.  This system was discovered in 1931 and the way it was brought about was this.  We 
had an engineering friend and helped him to learn something about an orange grove. 
 
He'd married into a family and they didn't know what to do with him so they bought an orange grove down in 
Florida and put him at the head of it, even though he didn't know an orange tree from a gra pefruit tree.  He 
didn't know anything about it, but he was a smart fellow so he hired somebody who did know to teach him 
how to run an orange grove for a profit, so he hired our firm to do that. 
 
Now this man lived the second or third door from my father and mother and he had a little boy, 21/2 years old, 
that had seizures.  On this particular day he'd had his little boy to the doctor and this young fellow came 
down that afternoon after 5 o'clock and he said, "I just had our little boy to the doctor today and the doctor 
tells me that he's going to go into a seizure and just not come out, that it's impossible for him to live until he's 
5 years old.  Medicine has failed, you just got to help me."  At this time the boy was having between 5 and 8 
seizures every day. 
 
So I went to the lab that night and I started working, or started thinking at least.  I was just sitting in a chair 
thinking and I couldn't think of a place to start.  Nowhere could I think of anything to do, or any way to start.  
If I could only think of a place to start or what to do, and for 3 days and nights I sat thinking, I mean I didn't 
sleep, I was frustrated, praying and fasting for something to know what to do.  The thought came into my 
mind, that if you knew what "perfect" was then you c ould find out what this little boy's body chemistry was.  
If you knew what a "perfect" body chemistry was then you could test this little fellow and find out how far 
from perfect he is and then make a diet to bring his body chemistry back to perfect.  I'm sure that the Lord 
himself put that message into my mind because I had my first clue then on what to do.  
 
Then by strictly calculus and working it through this equation resulted in 4 more days, although the original 
equation was much longer than that.  The n I brought the little boy in and we tested the stools, the urine, the 
saliva, the tears, the fingernails, the wax out of his ears, everything we could think of we tested, and then I 
made a diet for the little fellow and in just 90 days the seizures had pr actically stopped and after a few 
months they moved away to Texas to take over another project the family had bought on which they were 
losing money because he had made an excellent success of the grove in the year and a half he had been there.  
 
So they sent him out there and I lost contact with the family for 35 years, or thereabouts, and I was walking 
in the street of Orlando one day and this young man came up to me and he said, "aren't you Doctor Reams?"  
I said, "yes." 
He said, "I know you but you couldn't know me", 
I said, "no sir, I don't know you.  If I've ever seen you I don't remember."

He said, "you haven't seen me since I was about three and a half or four years old."  He said, "I was the little 
boy who had epilepsy, and you gave me a diet and I go t over it.  I didn't have any more seizures although at 
about 7 years old we were in a little fender -bending accident and I thought I might have had a light seizure 
then, but I haven't had one since.  I'm now happily married, and I have a family of my own" , and he also told 
me about his parents and things of that nature. 
 
But his problem was not epilepsy, it was diabetic seizures that he was having instead of epileptic seizures, his 
blood sugar was too low.  So this formula was born out of that, or came out  of that coupling and I have 
dropped off everything that was in repetition and now have it down to the basic facts because in the original 
formula that I had there was a duplication and repetition that was just more expensive and not necessary.  
 
So this is how come this equation become into existence."PART 1 
 
 
THE EQUATION 
 
 
 
The equation for "perfect" health was calculated mathematically and incorporates the elements of frequency, 
micronage, milli micronage and milli milli micronage of the human body.  Since every living species or "kind" of 
organism has a different frequency the equation for perfect health for different species must be different, and it is.  
The equation that shows "perfect" health for human beings is: 
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.40 saliva_ph=6.40 conductivity=6 to 7C cell_debris=.04M nitrate_nitrogen=3 ammonia_nitrogen=3
 
where: 
 
1.5  Total Carbohydrates in the urine measured by a refractometer in Brix units.  
 
6.40  Upper reading is the pH of the urine. 
 
6.40  Lower reading is the pH of the saliva. 
 
6 to 7 C The Conductivity reading of the urine measured in micromhos or microsiemens.  The "C" is 
the Roman symbol for 100, (so 600 – 700 micromhos or microsiemens). 
 
.04M  The debris, cellular waste or albumin in the urine.  The "M" means million.  
 
3  The upper 3 is the Nitrate Nitrogen. 
 
3  The lower 3 is the Ammonical Nitrogen reading. 
 
"6.40 over 6.40" and "3 over 3" are not division problems, they are separate factors that are considered on both their 
own merits and in relation with the other numbers. 
 
Also, a person's AGE, HEIGHT, WEIGHT, RACE, SEX and perhaps RELIGION ma y form part of the problem 
because all these things may have a bearing on what is going on in a specific person.  
 
When the term "NUMBERS" is referred to it means all of the following:  
 EQUATION, 
 AGE, 
 HEIGHT, 
 WEIGHT, 
 RACE, 
 SEX, and 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================
PAGE 10
============================================================

 
 
10 
 RELIGION. 
 
though not all of the above factors are of equal importance in all cases. 
 
For instance, if you take the following equation:

You don't know what's wrong with a person, or what to do, because you don't know the age, height and weight.  You 
need these in order to solve your problem.  For instance, there is a different problem in each of the three following 
examples: 
 
Problem 1. 
 
6 months, 28", 24 lb, male 
 
Equation of health: sugars=4.9 urine_ph=7.40 saliva_ph=6.80 conductivity=18 cell_debris=4 nitrate_nitrogen=10 ammonia_nitrogen=8
 
Problem 2. 
 
10 years, 5' 4", 76 lb, male 
 
Equation of health: sugars=4.9 urine_ph=7.40 saliva_ph=6.80 conductivity=18 cell_debris=4 nitrate_nitrogen=10 ammonia_nitrogen=8
 
Problem 3. 
 
42 years, 5' 11", 180 lb, male 
 
Equation of health: sugars=4.9 urine_ph=7.40 saliva_ph=6.80 conductivity=18 cell_debris=4 nitrate_nitrogen=10 ammonia_nitrogen=8
 
So as you can see, the age, height and weight makes a different problem.  Everybody is an individual and they need 
to be considered and counselled as such.  These three problems will be explained in detail later. 
 
 
PART 2 
 
 
CARBOHYDRATES AND THE PANCREAS 
 
 
Rule. Unless all numbers are perfect no numbers are perfect.  If one number is 1/10 out on a zone then the whole 
equation is out. 
 
Rule. The average blood chemistry over any 24 hour period will equal the average urine readings over the same 24 
hour period. 
 
Rule. When conducting follow up tests on the same or subsequent days the test that's critical is the sugars.  You 
don't want the sugars to drop too low because the lack of sugar in the urine means a lack of sugar in the blood 
which means a lack of oxygen to the brain. 
 
Rule. Alcohol is the greatest enemy calcium ever had.

Rule. One NO-NO about green drink and low blood sugar, never give comfrey, or comfrey tea, to people with low 
blood sugar because it lowers the sugar faster than anything else, but on all high blood sugar cases use plenty 
of it. 
 
Brix.  Brix is a unit of measurement and is an exact percentage of sugar. 
 
 
Sugars - General.   
 
 
Carbohydrates are the sugars and the sugar level determines the amount and type of oxygen that the blood will carry.  
In general: 
 the lower the urine carbohydrate reading the greater the oxygen in the blood, but the more the reading is 
below 1.5 brix towards 0.0 brix the more unusable  the oxygen is to the brain, i.e., it will not release to the 
brain, and 
 the higher the urine carbohydrate reading the lower the oxygen in the blood because there’s not enough room 
in the blood for both the carbohydrate and the oxygen. 
 
In summary, a sugar reading that is either too low or too high will result in lowered oxygen to the brain, and lowered 
oxygen to the brain can cause symptoms like irritability, fuzzy thinking, strange or unusual behaviour, and even 
blackouts. 
 
Remember, the results for high and low blood sugar are exactly the same, "not enough oxygen to the brain" and it is 
also common for some symptoms to be present in both the high and low sugar range so unless you know what range 
the sugar reading is in you cannot confidently make a health  assessment, or recommend the right course of action to 
correct the person's problem.  Would you trust your health to someone who has to make a best guess  on symptoms 
alone?  
 
Sugar Zones 
 
0 - 5.49 Low Blood Sugar (includes "perfect" 1.5 when all numbers are not perfect) 
0 - 1.0 Hypoglycaemic Zone - Low Blood Sugar (Danger Zone) 
1.0 - 2.0 Normal (Ideal) 
2.0 - 5.49 Zone of Misery 
5.50 - 8.50 Hyperglycaemic Zone - High Blood Sugar 
8.51 - 11.0 Danger Zone 
11.0 - 13.0 Fatal Zone      
 
Low Blood Sugar .  The Range 0 to 5.49 brix is classified as Low Blood Sugar and low blood sugar includes a 
reading of 1.5 brix when all numbers are not perfect. 
 
Low blood sugar causes people to be irritable and cross, and you need to keep in mind that they're not fighting 
people, they're fighting for their life, and if you understand that it helps a lot.  Now low calcium also causes people 
to be irritable, but when they have low calcium AND low sugar you've really got a wildcat on your hands, especially 
if it's your spouse beca use you have someone that has an exaggerated neurosis, an exaggerated tension, and those 
people are very hard to live with.  Also their resistance is low and their energy rating is dropping at a rather rapid 
rate and actually they are really in pitiful shape. 
 
One of the weaknesses of the sugar test that doctors use is that for maybe 23 hours and 55 minutes of the day your 
sugar may be running normal, but for that other 5 minutes you're either: 
 in a coma, or 
 you feel like you're going to die, or 
 you have pins and needles, or 
 you're sick at your stomach and nauseated.

you rush to the doctor, or the hospital, and by the time you get there the crisis has passed and they can't find a thing 
wrong with you and say, "it's all in your head."  They're right, it was all in your head, but they couldn't find it.  It 
was either: 
 low blood sugar, or 
 low potassium. 
 
Either one could have caused those sensations, and then because the adrenaline glands started to work it probably 
turned some fats in the body to a sugar and built the level back up and so the crisis passed. 
 
Now the doctors have no way of knowing what's wrong because they didn't find you with low blood sugar at that 
particular moment, so you keep doing this over and over and over for a few weeks to a month and then they say, 
"well I think we should do a sugar tolerance test". 
 
They do a sugar tolerance test and it comes out normal and your problem has not been found and it goes right on and 
on and on.  You're feeling fine, then suddenly you start to feel "funny"  or "odd" or "like nothing you've ever felt 
before" and maybe you even get blackouts, but by the time you get to the doctor to get checked out your blood 
sugar's come back up and you don't have that feeling. 
 
Now with blackouts there are two general types: 
 Slow Blackout.  This comes on slowly and you recognise the feeling and you know you've got to lay down 
and you don't care where it is, you've just got to lay down or you'll fall down because you're blacking out.  
 Fast Blackout.  You could be walking along and just like a snap of your fingers you fall, blacked out, and you 
don't remember falling or anything.  One second you're standing and the next you're getting up off the 
ground. 
 In Between Type.  Is a combination between the two, you may or may not feel " odd" and you may or may 
not have time to lay down before you black out. 
 
There's three causes of blackouts: 
 Low Blood Sugar. 
 Brain Tumor.  There's a brain tumor right on the top of the head pressing upon the edges of the medulla 
oblongata and the other section of the brain, or 
 Low Potassium.   
 
The danger line in the low blood sugar realm is 1.0, and you've got to know the tolerance.  It is more dangerous for 
an underweight to normal weight person to be under 1.0 than it is for someone who is overweight, be cause where 
there's a lot of fat the fat will release sugar for a number of days, but if they're anywhere near normal or below 
weight then they need something to eat right then.  Now you need to know the tolerance regardless of their weight 
but the more fat they have the less the tolerance means. 
 
Let's say you test a person and they have a reading of 6.0 so you send them home with a diet program and they come 
back in 3 days for a retest to see what effect you're having and the reading at 2.00 p.m. is 0.0.  Now don't become 
terribly excited if you see a 0.0, but don't let it stay that way very long because for a while nature can patch up and 
make up. 
 
Now theoretically this person should be in a coma but there they are, they walked in for a test, looking goo d and 
healthy and the thing that you need to do as quickly as possible is to get the sugar reading above 1.0.  If you have a 
reading like this then right then and there get them some prune juice to drink because they could pass out at any time 
unless they're extremely overweight with a lot of fat.  It also means that they need not only a sweetener in their 
lemon water every day, but also a DIFFERENT sweetener every day. 
 
Now if you have someone with a sugar reading of 1.0, and nothing handy except:  
 Sprite, or 
 the juice of some raisins that's soaked in water, or 
 even if you've got nothing else but white sugar give them some of that because a little bit of that is not going 
to do any harm,

anything, it doesn't matter what it is, so long as it's sweet, because  with a sugar reading under 1.0 you don't know 
how close to the danger zone you are, so just don't take a risk.  Do it right then.  
 
Now a half an hour after giving them something sweet do another test and see if you've got them up to somewhere 
near 1.0, and in all probability in that length of time the sugar may have risen to 4.0 or 5.0 or 6.0 or 7.0 because 
they've settled down, they're quiet, they're out of the cold, they're in a warm room.  The sugar number could even 
rise up as high as 9.0. 
 
If their sugar number is below 1.0 then do not let them drive because they could blackout at any moment and have a 
serious accident.  Even if they have to call somebody to come and drive their car home for them, do not permit them 
to drive when their sugar is below 1.0.  When the sugar comes up then it's safe for them to go home. 
 
Now let's suppose that we have a sugar reading of 5.0.  On the 1st day I would not put any sweetening in their lemon 
water but from the 2nd day I would.  Also if they get light headed or d izzy then tell them to carry a few raisins with 
them so that they can chew them slowly and immediately the sugar will come back up (because unless you have 
learned to figure the energy you won't know whether it's going to act quickly or slowly).  Now on th e 2nd day the 
sugar will probably drop below 1.5 and before the day's over it could well be in the hypoglycaemic zone and you'll 
need to bring it up. 
 
Always "Go By The Numbers". 
 
At some point you may have 2 clients sitting in your office at the same time , one with a reading of 1.6 and the other 
with a reading of 5.0 and you tell each of them they have low blood sugar.  They'll sit there and shake their heads, 
how can both have low blood sugar when their numbers are so different.  So the people also need t o be taught and 
educated.  In talking with many clients one of the things that helps the most is to let them know that their body is 
akin to a car, and the blood to sugar ratio is much like oxygen and gasoline, the proper mixture gives you the most 
energy. 
 
With low blood sugar they're starving the brain of oxygen, and they're probably:  
 under a lot of stress, 
 working very hard, or 
 in need of more rest. 
 
their blood carries too much oxygen and they run out of steam.  By saying too much oxygen it's actually o xygen in a 
non usable form to the brain. 
 
What Doc Reams means by low blood sugar is when you consume something you're not supposed to, or your body 
can't handle and the reading goes all over the place and when that happens you'll notice that they quickly run down. 
 
The lower the energy the more the numbers will fluctuate.  With low blood sugar, the sugar level's at one point and a 
later test on the same or next day will show a significant variation.  For instance, a test may show a 5.2 and later that 
day or the next day they could be at 0.9, and that's the low blood sugar syndrome, they'll change even within ten 
minutes or less. 
 
Low blood sugar causes a lack of oxygen to the brain and is the cause of: 
 motion sickness, 
 about 50% of the automobile accidents, and 
 highway hypnosis is always low blood sugar, never high blood sugar.  
 
0 - 1.0 (Hypoglycaemic Zone).  This is also called "Dangerously Low Sugar", or "Severe Low Blood Sugar".  
Under ordinary circumstances with a zero reading and a total tolerance of 0. 6 most people go into a comatose 
condition or spasms. 
 
Very low blood sugar is one cause of children having convulsions or spasms or seizures, which are all the same 
thing.  About 80% of all the medically diagnosed epileptics in the United States are not e pileptics at all, they are 
having low sugar seizures, and most of the time the doctor gives them Dilantin which effects the adrenaline glands

and increases the ionization between the brain and the vital organs through the vagus nerve and helps to bring the m 
out of a seizure, or even keeps them from going into one, but you have to know what the blood sugar is doing, 
whether it's a low blood sugar seizure or not. 
 
In a severe low blood sugar zone the heart beat can do all sorts of things too, like palpitate i rregularly, but it can do 
all kinds of different things with different people. 
 
Sometimes when you have people on a diet at home the family will call you and say the person is:  
 having a seizure, 
 in a comatose condition, 
 asleep, and they can't be woken up, 
 stiffened up, they're just perfectly stiff and they've thrown their head back,  
 thrashing around with their arms or kicking with their legs, 
 their legs are twisted together or something, or 
 they may be doing all kinds of things. 
 
There's no two seizures ali ke.  Just keep your cool and tell them to put a little honey on their tongue, and in one 
minute they'll be back.  Now a hypoglycaemic may be able to take fructose or other sugars between meals to keep 
the blood sugar up but you'd have to try it, test it and see what happens, though raisins are generally a better way. 
 
If their sugars remain too low, say below 1.0, then reduce their water intake and have them to eat just one fruit a day, 
or one food a day, and so forth in order to try and find out which: 
 food, 
 sweetener, 
 starch, or 
 oil 
 
they're having that's causing the pancreas to flush, and then just discard that one.  At this time do not eat food 
combinations, eat single items and you'll find out very quickly which it is, but this should be a retreat case.  
 
A foetus uses 3 to 5 hundred per cent more oxygen than we do and it gets its oxygen only through the mother's 
blood stream.  In places where there's a high smog content then the unwanted and undesirable natural abortion rate is 
greater than in areas where there is pure, clean air. 
 
A sugar reading of 1.0 brix is the point at which the mother's urine sugar must not drop below or she will abort, and 
it is very important to know whether the mother has emphysema and whether she's getting enough oxygen or not 
and one of the sad things is that smoking mothers have a higher natural abort ratio than non -smoking mothers. 
 
1.5 - 2.0.  Basically this means that we're getting most of the energy that we need, their energy supply meets their 
demands.  As we go above 1.5 the blood begins to carry a little more sugar and a little less oxygen, because it cannot 
carry sugar and oxygen at the same time in the ratio that you need at 1.5, therefore it gives up the oxygen.  
 
If your sugar levels are normal or low then you can eat  your sweets all through the day, but it's best to eat most of 
them in the morning part of the day because that's when you need the energy.  When you have "low blood sugar" 
fruit can always be eaten but there's also a question of, "can they have enough to raise the sweetness level?" because 
they're going to be washing a lot out if they're going to be drinking the right amount of water.  
 
Now the behaviour of the sugar number does all sorts of things: 
 There are some people that will never come close to 1.5. 
 There are some people who will hover around 1.5, 1.6, 1.7. 
 There are some people who will come close to 1.5 but their body chemistry doesn't turn off soon enough and 
they slide right on by it and down below 1.5. 
 
Now suppose that you have any sugar reading except 1.5 and then the next test shows 1.5.  Understand that the sugar 
is not perfect, because all numbers are not perfect.

Try to keep the sugar reading between 1.0 and 2.0, and that's all that's required to keep your weight to where it is 
normal, and n ormal isn't what you want it to be.  Normal is what your genetic structures says it should be.  Your 
normal weight is related to the size of your head, feet, bones, joints, hereditary aspects, the condition of the thyroid, 
and size of the heart and many ot her things, and your genetic code doesn't have anything to do with the chart of a 
perfect figure or a figure that everybody adores. 
 
If your pancreas is working correctly and your numbers are perfect you should be able to throw anything at it by 
way of a s weetness nature and the insulin sugar reaction should keep you at 1.5, 1.6 with a relatively minor 
variation. 
 
The sugar reading anywhere between 1 and 2 on an average first test is very good, providing the other numbers are 
proportionally out.  It is better to have a sugar number between 1 and 2 on a first test stay between 1 and 2 in the 
consecutive test than it is to have one at 3.0 or 4.5 or 5.2 come in at 1.5 on a second test because there's more 
fluctuation in the second case.  In other words, the  further out these numbers are the lower the reserve energy and 
the more dilute the gastric juices, period. 
 
2.0 to 5.49 (Zone of Misery).   In his classes "Doc" Reams compared the people in the Zone of Misery to being 
much like two cats having their tails tied together and then draped over a clothes line.  Each cat thinks the other one 
is the cause of its problem, hence it will fight. 
 
Whenever you have a person tests 7.0 or above on your sugar level and you lower it to just on the 5.50 mark they'll 
get along very fine at home, but from 5.49 down to 2.0 is called the Zone of Misery and one of the things that people 
often do is get their body chemistry into that Zone of Misery, they feel like something the cat's dragged in and 
couldn't eat and they're just simply miserable, and the first thing you know misery loves company and their favourite 
song becomes, "Nobody knows the trouble I've seen .." and they're simply miserable because their body chemistry is 
out. 
 
When you lower the sugar level from the high suga r range to about 1.5 the person may very well get headaches or 
nausea and in this case the finest thing in the world is to let them suffer through it because if you add any sweets it'll 
only prolong their misery.  Now their head hurts, and because their fa vourite headache remedy won't affect their 
chemistry, they can have it to help get them through, but having sugars and starches will affect their sugar level and 
will only prolong their misery. 
 
By taking many married couples who were fighting and ready fo r the divorce courts to a retreat, and not even giving 
them marriage guidance counselling or anything else but simply reducing their sugar levels out of the Zone of 
Misery the couple settled down, talked and their problems tended to level out and shrink do wn.  It's Doc's prayer that 
more ministers will be aware of this sugar relationship and they'll begin to look into how a person in the Zone of 
Misery can be helped out of that zone so that no only the victim but others around him or her will be more 
understanding and acceptable. 
 
When the sugar reading is in the Zone of Misery (2.0 - 5.49): 
 the person is tired, 
 there's usually a tightness in the chest, 
 tightness in the shoulder blades, 
 the back is also tight, 
 the whole person feels like they are being bound together, and 
 quite often they are very irritable. 
 
You could just walk up to them and say, "Good Morning", or anything, and you have a fight on your hands.  Quite 
often husbands or wives will say something to the other and it's misunderstood and causes a n argument. 
 
5.49. Now let's take a sugar reading of 5.49, and we'll draw a line through it.  5.49 and below denotes a low blood 
sugar whereas 5.50 and above denotes a high blood sugar.  In that one tenth there's not much difference but it is 
critical and the main thing that's very important about that number is it seems to be both stable and accurate for 
everybody.  There is a distinct line at 5.49 in body chemistry that you can depend on.

============================================================

5.49 is the mark that in about 99.98% of the people this will be the margin line that if the reading rises above it won't 
drop below without being directed.  Under the numbers you'll find about .02% of people who will have both a low 
blood sugar and an ext remely high blood sugar on the same day, and the suspicion for those people is either cancer 
of the liver or the pancreas.  
 
At 5.49 and below is low blood sugar and there SHOULD be sweetener in their lemonade, and sweetener refers to 
natural sweeteners.  Honey is not the only one, in fact there is also: 
 white Karo syrup, 
 red Karo syrup, 
 rice syrup, 
 treacle, 
 golden syrup, 
 sorghum syrup, 
 cane syrup, 
 dark brown sugar, 
 maple syrup, 
 blackstrap molasses, 
 the different varieties of honey. 
 
Never recommend one swe etener only.  Remember, people are supposed to be on a sweetener rotation basis, that is 
approximately 1 sweetener a day for at least 3 days, preferably 5 days, then start over again, because you will find 
some people with an intolerance to honey, or to any number of other natural sweeteners. 
 
Now if three subsequent sugar tests show readings of: 
 3.0 
 1.4, and 
 1.0 
 
and you're sure the person was on sweetener then they would definitely be losing energy.  
 
If you see this reduction, even from 3.0 to 1.4, and they're on sweetener, then it's the wrong kind of sweetener and 
the body is not responding, whereas if they were not on sweetener then it may be a normal decline especially with 
the amount of water they're drinking.  In other words, going from 1.4 to 1.0 a nd the person was using sweetener and 
still the reading went down then it's a definite energy loss, if it's just water alone, without sweetener, then you may 
be washing it out and a natural dilution may be taking place.  In this case the person was on swee tener so there's an 
energy loss. 
 
Even though honey is quite often the universal sweetening agent there are some people for whom it reverses its 
effect.  If the person is on sweetener and the readings keep going down or stay low you need to find out which 
sweetener is wrong and change it because when a person has a sugar intolerance the sugar reading stays low or 
actually drops.  You think you're giving them sweetener and you should be lifting the reading but instead the body 
reacts to it and it drops, and this is Doc's reasoning for you having at least three sweeteners.  The important thing is 
to rotate the sweeteners to reduce the chances of intolerance reactions. 
 
Now if the person is using a sweetener and the sugars stay too low it could also mean that t hey're allergic to 
lemonade, but many times it may go back even further than that.  For instance many times there's nothing wrong 
with the pancreas except that the liver is in such poor or bad shape until it has not had time to rebuild, to 
manufacture the correct amount of its enzymes in the pancreas to control your body problems.  So the pancreas often 
gets blamed for something that it's not guilty of because it did not have the supply.  The story on "Tobacco Road" 
illustrates this fact of cause and effect .  The girl had no income and she had to feed her babies because she loved 
them and she had no way to do it except to break the law. 
 
Now, your pancreas is something like that girl, it's willing to do anything in the world that's got anything to do with 
it, but the liver's not supplying, the liver's acting as the welfare board and just as the welfare board wasn't supplying 
the girl so your liver is not supplying the pancreas, and so your poor pancreas rebels and does the best it can and 
kicks these numbers all over creation and you lose energy.

If you have a client with low blood sugar that absolutely does not care for sweetener at all, you should still insist 
upon it because it is what their system needs.  The depth of the need depends a lot on the other n umbers but if their 
program calls for it you tell them to do it. 
 
If the sweetener in water or lemon water makes them gag purely because of the sweetness then one solution may be 
to take the sweetener straight and then drink the water so that it is not act ually sweet water that they're drinking and 
maybe these are some little games you've got to play to get your clients to take in the water, or the sweetener or the 
lemon juice at some point. 
 
If your clients need sweetener have them add it as follows: 
 Reading 5.4 to 4.5.  Two Tablespoons of sweetener to every 1.2 litres (40 oz) of water they drink.  
 Below 4.5.  This is where it gets a little touchy.  In Doc's words, "you have them add sweetener until it tastes 
sweet" and that's as subjective as you can get because what is sweet to you may not be sweet to me.   
 
The point is, they've got to be taking some sweetness in and this is Doc's guidance, that if it's below 4.5 they add 
sweetener until it's sweet. 
 
Now you'll find there are times when people drink water,  and they drink sweet water, no lemon at all, because if 
they just drank straight water you'd flush them right off the floor, they'd have no sugar left in them.  So some people 
have to do this.  Remember, go by the numbers. 
 
Strange Effects of Low Blood Su gar.  One woman reported some problems that she's never had answered by the 
doctors.  When she was young and feeling perfectly well she'd go out during summer and sometimes really low, 
dark clouds would come across and as soon as they approached she'd get a violent pain and feel like vomiting 
immediately, no warning whatsoever.  Sometimes she'd also have motion sickness in boats and sometimes she'd feel 
nauseated when up on a high mountain.  Those effects are all due to low blood sugar.  
 
High Blood Sugar 
 
5.50 is a tendency to high blood sugar.  If you have a tendency towards high blood sugar on the first test then you do 
not eat fruits or sweets after 2.00 o'clock in the day, or white potatoes for about a year.  You will find a lot of people 
that are completely allergic to Irish potato and it makes them very ill.  Also, do NOT give carrot juice to anyone that 
is high blood sugar or on sugar controlling drugs like insulin, diabinese, orinate, diabinate.  
 
Inside of the central core of the eye there is a lot o f fluid and whenever the body chemistry begins to get too many 
carbohydrates then that fluid begins to increase and it's the first sign of a diabetic person.  You've heard people say, 
"that child has the most beautiful big brown eyes", or "big blue eyes", or "big hazel eyes".  All they're saying is that 
child has diabetes, or is a candidate for diabetes. 
 
6.00 and Above, General.  For 6.0 and above it's not so much a matter of which zone you're in, because when you 
start hitting 6.0 and go up from there you  have problems no matter where you go, and you better not try and work 
with someone up in the higher ranges very long.  So at 6.0 and above you should see a big red flag waving at you 
that this person needs immediate help, and you don't wait: 
 You know that they're entering the diabetic range, 
 There's fluid retention and puffiness, and 
 Vision is affected. 
 
The symptoms of high blood sugar are related to the level, age and duration and you need to check:  
 Their eating patterns. 
 The type of food they're eating. 
 Their elimination habits, because when someone tends to become constipated it effects the elimination of 
fluids because they retain more fluids. 
 Their work schedule or life habits, because depending on what they do, the high sugar could be highest and 
affect them most first thing in the morning, especially if they haven't been having any water.  For others, their 
sugar level will rise through the day as they eat and it'll continue to go up and up and up, and by the end of

the day they just have trouble focussing and seeing. 
 Headaches are quite a common thing.  When you start to deprive the brain of the oxygen it needs, and you've 
got all kinds of sugars when the reading is up but you don't have an awful lot of oxygen, then headaches will 
take place.  People will complain about dull headaches for years, they'll come in and say, "I don't know why I 
have headaches, I feel pretty good except I have headaches all the time" and quite often when you test them 
you'll find their sugar level is extremely high.  Get th e sugar level down, and when their sugar level comes 
down you'll find the phone ringing within a short period of time, "my headache's gone", and then they call us 
back in a couple of weeks, "it's still gone, we've never had this happen before", and all we' ve done is a rather 
mechanical thing and that is lower the sugar level. 
 Vitamin A is not being utilised when you have such a high sugar. 
 Potassium will generally be absent from the system because you just cannot take it in, it's not available.  
Remember, the further out the numbers the lower the reserve energy and the more dilute the gastric juice.  
 
5.50 - 7.50.  The Fatigue Zone is from approximately 5.50 to 7.50.  Many people will say if you had to have them 
describe themselves they would say, "I just don 't feel good, I don't know what's wrong, I just feel punky, I just can't 
put my finger on it."  The fatigue zone.  In this zone a person can be: 
 Frequent headaches, 
 Still irritable, but it's a different type, it's not a perennial thing, they're not just al ways that way. 
 Body, leg and foot sores.  In general slow healing. 
 Frequently Tired.  The main characteristic is that anything you ask them to do is just too much trouble, too 
much effort, and if you push them you're liable to end up with somebody on your hands who's crying.  Their 
emotions are right there at the surface.  You may have quite a few young people, teens and preteens, who are 
this way, and when their sugars are running into the 6's and 7's they are just tired.  Now if you think about 
most of th e foods that people of that age are eating or drinking then you'll understand a great deal why.  
Many of them have an attitude of "put off 'til tomorrow what they should be doing today" and you think that 
they're trying to con you, but they're not, they really feel this way and it's because of the sugars. 
 
At a sugar of 7.2 the body is functioning as a diabetic, even if the patient is one year old and the condition has 
existed only a short while, as far as the body is concerned at the time of the test it wa s diabetic and the pancreas was 
responding as if it was a diabetic.  However, due to the age factor of a 1 year old though it may not stay that way too 
long.   
 
Danger Zone 8.0 - 11.0  
 
Near 10 
 If you start getting up into the area of anywhere near 10 or a bove you could enter into a coma and many 
people who are diabetics are acquainted with that.  What is happening is they have an imbalance of oxygen 
and sugar and the body responds the only way it can, it closes down. 
 
Fatal Zone 11.0 - 13.0 
 
There was a call into the retreat in Roanoke where a child had a sugar reading of 11.0.  The tester asked the parents, 
"is the child on insulin or sugar controlling drugs?" 
The father said, "No." 
"Has the child ever been?" 
"No." 
The tester told the parents to get the child into the retreat at the earliest moment possible. 
 
The parents took the child to the doctor and the doctor said, "the child is not a diabetic".  Three days later the parents 
called and made a reservation for the child, but the very next morning when th ey went to wake the child up it was 
dead in the bed, because at sugar 11 most people die, at 13 all die. 
 
So they called in and cancelled the reservation because their child went to sleep and never awakened.  What 
happened there?  The child died in his sle ep from a lack of oxygen to the brain.  Now if the system is throwing off 
that much sugar it means there is a terrific deficiency of oxygen to the brain.  Now if there is a potassium deficiency

19 
and an oxygen deficiency you die around 11, but if there is pl enty of potassium and just the high sugar then it's 
about 13 in ratio.  Those are your fatal marks and these are factors that you should remember.  
 
Diabetes 
 
Doc Reams was firmly of the opinion that a diabetic was most often created by the food the person eats and doesn't 
eat, which then causes mineral deficiencies, which then effects them later in life.  If a true diabetic is on insulin, 
orinase or debenese then their sugar level will go below 5.5. 
 
Allopathic Sugar Scale .  Here are some facts about blood sugar.  The allopathic blood sugar is measured on only 
one kind of sugar and that's glucose, and the glucose tolerance test (GTT) is only about 50% accurate because 
certain people can digest certain kinds of sugars but can't digest other kinds of sugars an d therefore it only works 
about 50% of the time. 
 
The scale that doctors go by is: 
 70 - 90 mg of glucose / gram of blood is normal 
 above 120 mg of glucose / gram of blood is diabetic. 
 
There's a ratio that's very important on the allopathic diabetic scale in that you're considered to be a diabetic at 120 
mg of glucose per gram of blood and anything above that would be a diabetic and anything below it wouldn't be.  At 
119.9 you're not a diabetic, but at 120 you are.  Now some doctors use 130 mg, some 135 mg,  some 140 mg, but 
when do you actually become a diabetic? 
 
You actually become a diabetic anytime the GTT number moves above 40 mg, yet Mercks says you have diabetic 
tendencies at 80 mg.  Some people become diabetics whenever their glucose is 80 yet others  do not become diabetic 
until their numbers get to 140 or even 160.  Now what they're not taking into consideration is the ratio between your 
total carbohydrates and your glucose.   
 
Now these medical allopathic numbers are determined by taking a large num ber of people, say 1000 or 10, 000 
people that looked healthy and this is what they found.  Now these numbers were not based on a gain or loss of 
energy, they were based on appearance only, and they are inaccurate. 
 
Now if you went to a doctor and you had 119.9 glucose you would not be diabetic, but if you had 120 you probably 
would be, however he probably wouldn't do anything about it if you had 120 until your sugar got to be about 130 
and then he'd first put you on diabenese, or orinate or diabenate, but when it gets to 145 or 150 then he'd put you on 
insulin. 
 
This is the method of treatment used by the medical profession, and although I'm not casting any reflection on the 
medical profession you who are doctors will agree with the overall picture of it, a nd there's a variable even among 
doctors. 
 
All the way through the GTT the doctors use glucose readings, for instance you may have a man at 80 mg glucose, 
and a total carbohydrate reading in the urine of 5.4 brix and he would be a full -fledged diabetic and  if it stays long 
enough he'd have every symptom of a diabetic, the eyeballs are carrying extra fluid and they become enlarged and 
the vision is also effected; sores that don't heal, scruffies that stay too long, body, leg or foot sores and things of that 
nature.  Overall there'll be slow healing and so forth. 
 
Now notice this, the blood glucose has been known to go as high as 500 mg of glucose, yet they had a 1.5 total 
carbohydrates in the urine and the glucose didn't affect them.  Theoretically they'd be in serious trouble, say 
comatose, or you'd be able to tell that something terrible was happening to them, but there wasn't.  There's been no 
correlation that I know of that's been made between the total carbohydrates in the urine and the glucose tolerance 
readings. 
 
Here are some facts that you need to remember.  You may have 1.5 brix refractometer test yet have a 300 mg, 400 
mg or even 500 mg glucose test and be perfectly alright, no bad effects at all.

However the higher the sugar goes on your refractometer reading the more damage you'll get from the glucose 
reading, in other words, if you have 1.5 Brix and a glucose reading anywhere from 150 to 500 mg you're 
comparatively safe on glucose, but if the refractometer reading was 5.50 and you had 15 0 mg glucose you're in 
trouble, in other words, you are a full fledged diabetic according to the doctors numbers.  
 
So this is the relationship or tolerance between glucose and your total carbohydrate.  The refractometer number is a 
reading of your total carbohydrate whereas the doctor only measures the glucose. 
 
Now you might say how do we know?  Well if this is the only problem the people have, and is the only reason for 
them to begin to lose Reserve Energy, then that is the line that determines the accura cy of these equations. 
 
Sugar Controlling Drugs.  If people are on sugar controlling drugs like: 
 insulin, 
 orinate, "Orinase" (tolbutamide), 
 debenate, "Diabinese" (chlorpropamide), and also includes the other members of the same family, like 
"Dymelor" (acetohexamide) and "Tolinase" (tolazamide). 
 
then they are a candidate for the retreat, which is another way of saying you should not get involved with it as much 
as you want to, you should not get involved with it at home and under no circumstances do you eve r: 
 take a person off of insulin or their medication, or 
 put them on a fast.  If they are a diabetic or being controlled chemically you do NOT put them on a fast.  
 
Glucose is one form of sugar and sugar is a rather tricky substance.  For instance, some carb ohydrates will cause the 
pancreas not to manufacture enough insulin and others will cause it to manufacture too much insulin, so the idea of 
the diabetic being taken off all sweets and put on all meats is only another way of saying, "I don't want you to di e as 
a diabetic, I want you to die of a heart attack."  He's just as dead one way or the other.  Now a diabetic also drinks 
water like it's going out of style, if he didn't he'd be dead a long time before.  
 
If people have sugar problems and want to use sug ar substitutes it's perfectly alright and the chemicals in it won't 
affect you one way or the other because it relates back to the frequency of the body, and later you'll learn that if you 
take something into your body and it's not on the right frequency it'll pass right on through. 
 
Now this holds true for diet colas and things of that type if somebody is more or less addicted to them  but only as 
far as the sugar is concerned, but as far as the caffeine or coal tar substitutes it may not be and this is so mething 
you'll have to work out individually. 
 
Diabetic Child.   People with a sugar of 5.50 or above should NOT be put on lemon water and water fast because 
when their body chemistry starts to react it'll generally overreact, and when it overreacts that's  what gets you into 
trouble, especially so in children because their bodies respond very quickly, the X factor, 1X, 2X and so forth and 
that goes even for children of maybe preschool age.  They can have diabetes too and you'll work on those later, but 
you can tell very quickly with a child because they gain Reserve Energy much faster than an adult in recuperating, 
but they also lose it faster, so be careful in dealing with children.  Don't ever attempt to try to handle a child with 
diabetes, send them to a retreat and I'll tell you why. 
 
Suppose you came across a child who was not on insulin, or other sugar controlling drugs, but they had such a high 
sugar that sugar controlling drugs would be the doctor's next step, well that child has a terrific amount of pressure, 
hypertension, inside and if you put them on a lemon water and water fast or a program and their sugar drops then 
that child will go through a rather severe withdrawal, vomiting, sick stomach and so forth and the parents will be 
most deeply concer ned about what is happening because after the child vomits two or three times it'll then go to 
sleep, and will sleep anywhere from 12 to 30 hours, and you'll find it difficult to wake at all, it's just like a dish rag, 
the eyes roll back in the head and it scares mommy and daddy to death almost. 
 
The child won't be giving you much problem but the parents will, they're just sure you're killing the child and that 
the diet is impossible and they'll call you up at any hour of the day or night and I don't blame them, they're deeply 
concerned about their child.

Parents don't like to see their children vomit, but yet you know, and you've already told them what would happen but 
it didn't really strike home that it could happen.  Please if you run a retreat tell the  people what to expect before it 
happens.  When the first upchuck comes: 
 it's very green, 
 then it turns brown, and 
 then yellow 
 
and it doesn't last very long.  But immediately after the child upchucks, if it's through the day in about 5, 10 or 15 
minutes they're feeling better than ever.  This upchucking is not a lingering, hanging on type of illness.  
 
After the vomit begins to turn yellow the child will go to sleep and it will sleep anywhere from 12 to 30 hours and 
it's very difficult to wake the child up at all, it's as limber as a dishrag.  The child is in a very, very deep sleep 
because it's so relaxed because the tension from the high sugar has been released.  Whenever this condition exists 
check the pulse and temperature and go by that because a child seldom has a temperature whenever they go through 
withdrawal, seldom ever, and you'll generally find both the pulse and temperature is normal and everything else, 
including the numbers, is doing just fine.  They generally do wake up just long enough to bar ely get to the bathroom 
and so forth but it's difficult to keep them awake long enough to eat anything at all they're so relaxed.  
 
When that happens to the child it scares mummy plumb to death even with advance warning, and I'm going to tell 
you if mommy's there you can kinda get along but if daddy's there mommy's going to excite daddy and he's ready to 
fight you.  He is ready to fight you and you have to comfort them and guide them and this is no job for an average 
tester in the field. 
 
Now I've had it to happen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times and I know what they'll do but then the 
child wakes up and he's rested, the hypertension is gone and you should see the energy that kid's got.  He just 
bounces all over the place, he's absolutely obedient,  where he had horns before the parents begin to look for wings 
because he's so obedient, so anxious to please and it's really remarkable what has happened, then the parents are 
very, very happy about it but, during this withdrawal on a child it's really so mething to take them through it and 
what I'm trying to say is the child won't give you much problem but the parents will.  
 
Never, never, never touch a child that's on insulin, send them to a retreat and let the retreat take that responsibility 
because they have to be tested every hour of the day and through the night, also one of the things that you have to be 
very careful about with a child that has high blood sugar that the sugar will drop too low and the child will go into 
convulsions and that too scares  a mother and father plumb to death, and all they know to do is put them in warm 
water, that's what the doctor says do, but all you need to do is put a little honey on their tongue and then in one 
minute they're back to normal again.  So what I'm trying to  say is these are not cases for the average tester to try and 
handle, don't attempt it. 
 
I'm not trying to get people in a retreat I'm trying to keep peace in your neighbourhood, and keep the police off your 
neck and keep that person out of the hospital be cause the first thing you know if they're trying to do this at home the 
kid's in a hospital and it was the diet that you gave him that almost killed him, and then you're under investigation 
and your troubles have really begun.  So these are things that you need to memorize and if you think that you can get 
along without them you've got another thought coming. 
 
 
Pancreas 
 
The pancreas manufactures three major things that are essential to life and health and if you can get your pancreas to 
function normally it will do great things for you.  The things it manufactures are:  
 Alcohol.  Everyone's got a built -in whiskey still and it's the alcohol manufactured by the pancreas that 
controls our temperature.  Alcohol in our system is not made by fermentation, it is m anufactured.  Some of 
the books says it is and some of them says it isn't, but it is manufactured.  With people that are too cold all the 
time their pancreas does not manufacture enough alcohol and people that are too hot have too much alcohol.  
 Insulin.  O ften the pancreas doesn't manufacture enough insulin because the liver doesn't manufacture 
enough glycogen, and while it's not the only substance, it's the main one the pancreas uses to manufacture 
insulin, and

============================================================

============================================================

 
 
22 
 Thyroxine.  This is a cationic substance made  in the pancreas, sent to the thyroid where potassium is added 
and you get thyrotoxin, the worn out cell. 
 
Alcohol 
 
The pancreas has special cells called the Islets of Langerhans which occur in clusters, or masses or groups and when 
looked at under a powerful microscope they look like the skin of a porcupine with its quills. 
 
Glycogen is a polysaccharide of linked glucose molecules which is formed in the liver.  When glycogen comes into 
the pancreas it passes over the needlepoints of those pancreatic cells and the first thing formed is alcohol.  Sugar is 
C6H22O11 or O12 and as the sugar passes over the points it is pulled apart by de ionization and alcohol, C 2H5OH, is 
formed by ionization along the line of least resistance.  One interesting thing about alcoho l is that you can take a 
bottle full of water, and it doesn't matter what size bottle, and then add 8% more in alcohol and still not run it over 
because there's plenty of room for the alcohol to get in between the atoms of water in there, there's that much  space. 
 
The alcohol the pancreas manufactures is similar to 94 Proof Gin and the purpose of the alcohol is to:  
 keep the body warm, and 
 keep the digestion functioning properly. 
 
It takes one drop of pancreatic alcohol per 100 pounds, or 45 kilograms, of body weight every 30 to 60 minutes 
throughout the day to maintain proper body temperature.  If there is not enough alcohol produced by the pancreas 
the body temperature will be somewhat lower than it should be, and they'll complain of being too cold all th e time.  
If they have cold hands and cold feet all the time it's NOT poor circulation, it's because the pancreas is not 
manufacturing sufficient alcohol to warm their whole body.  You can usually tell if a person has cold hands by when 
you first meet them,  if you shake their hand.  Low alcohol may also cause acute indigestion, and you can tell the 
difference between whether the patient is having a heart attack or whether they are having acute indigestion because 
with acute indigestion you have cold hands and cold feet, low alcohol. 
 
If people have spasmodic production of alcohol then they'll complain of hot flushes, especially in the earlier part of 
the day. 
 
If people have too much alcohol in the system they'll complain that: 
 they're too hot.  They may have hot extremities, hot feet, hot hands, and so on. 
 alcohol evaporates quicker than water, and it also has a heating effect on the inside of the body, and the heat 
inside of the body has an effect upon the alveoli in the lung.  If you've got too much alcohol  inside your 
system that little alveoli isn't going to open up, it's going to stay closed like a ball and moisture's going to 
form inside that cavity, and 
 in the morning hours they may have a slight headache, which is a hangover, and that's even from eatin g white 
potatoes. 
 
Now people who come in with this headache problem, which is their major problem, would be told "you're an 
alcoholic." 
"But I've never touched a drop of alcohol or wine in my life". 
"I didn't say you had, I just said you're an alcoholic, and it's your own pancreas that's manufacturing too much 
alcohol." 
 
If they complain about getting up in the morning with a headache, the way to tell whether it's from too much alcohol 
or from something else is to ask them to drink a glass of water immedia tely when they get up.  If the headache goes 
away it's because they've had too much alcohol in their system, and the headache's going to come back later on, plus 
they're going to have a little bit of dizziness.  If it doesn't go away from drinking the wate r then the headache's from 
some other cause of which there's many.  Maybe constipation, and so forth. 
 
Now sometimes the headache will go away about 10.00 or 11.00 o'clock in the morning (or even at another time) if 
they do nothing, then if they drink a gl ass of water it'll come back.  Now the water does that because it reactivates 
the alcohol because they haven't drunk enough water to wash it out of their system.  Remember about the alcohol, if

you take a glass of water and fill it to the top and then pour  pure alcohol in it it's going to slide in among those water 
molecules. 
 
Now the Florida hospital had over a thousand beds and Doc Reams was called there by a doctor (M.D.) that had a 
patient who was a deacon in the Presbyterian church.  The deacon had com e to the doctor for a week, highly 
inebriated, and swore to the doctor that he didn't drink a drop, never touched it.  Of course a lot of the people that 
drink alcohol will say that, and so the doctor didn't believe it, but he put the deacon in the hospita l for two weeks 
solitary confinement. 
 
After a week and a half the deacon was still as inebriated as the day he was when they put him in there, and that's 
when Doc Reams was called on the case.  The first thing he asked the doctor when he got there was, "l et me see the 
man's chart and his diet that he's been getting in that hospital" because in that hospital the patient orders the foods 
one day for the next, and all the deacon was ordering was sweets and starches and breads and they were turning into 
alcohol, and so before he ever saw the patient, even before a test was done on him he said, "take all the sweets away 
from this man and give him only vegetables," and in three days he was sober.  His own pancreas manufactured 
enough alcohol to keep him inebriated. 
 
Now the body burns fats by converting them to carbohydrate, that is fats to sugar, and the pancreas converts sugar to 
alcohol and the alcohol makes heat in the body by the action of the frequency of the particles rubbing together, 
creating anions of he at by friction.  Now the temperature of collective anions is 980 deg Celsius and the thing that 
keeps the anions in your body from burning a hole in you is that there is enough space in the cationic matrix for 
them to get out without burning a hole, for in stance, a man smoking a cigarette walking through a double garage 
door does not burn a hole because he has plenty of room to get out.  In other words, alcohol creates a high amount of 
friction and the friction kicks off the anions and they have plenty of room to pass out of the body. 
 
Now the pancreas manufactures alcohol to keep the body warm and functioning at the right temperature and if it's 
making too much alcohol you are too hot all the time.  To reduce the amount of alcohol in the body drink some 
Brazilian Tea made from coffee (weak black coffee where you can see the bottom of a teacup, and NOT one like 
molasses that's strong enough to stand up and dare you to attack it) and in those cases the coffee often makes them 
sick at their stomach, and that 's exactly what you want to happen, and praise God it is because it's trying to change 
their body chemistry.  If they won't take coffee because they don't like the taste of it then shame on them, and 
anybody that tells you that.  Just tell them to make out their last will and testimony. 
 
You know good health is not a lot of do -do's and no -no's, good health is using the right thing at the right time, for 
instance, the caffeine in coffee is the greatest enemy that alcohol ever had and if your pancreas is manu facturing too 
much alcohol and you're hot all the time, or have hot flushes during menopause, a little bit of Brazilian Tea will help 
dilute that alcohol until you'd be more comfortable.  What I'm trying to say is there is a time for coffee, but if you've 
got to have a cup of coffee every morning for a crutch then you need more mineral of some kind and you'd better 
find whatever it is that you need.  Now people that drink wine and drink coffee at the same meal are only throwing 
nature into confusion because they act in opposition to each other. 
 
People that drink a lot of alcohol get cirrhosis of the liver because it destroys the calcium in the liver.  Remember, 
alcohol in excessive amounts is the greatest enemy calciums ever had, and alcohol dilutes or dest roys the gastric 
juice by the destruction of the calcium in the liver.  In other words, the more calcium that's destroyed in the liver the 
more dilute the gastric juice becomes, and some people's own system will manufacture too much alcohol and this 
still causes their gastric juice to be too dilute.  If you're healthy you don't need to drink alcohol at all and it will make 
you too hot if you do, and if your pancreas is manufacturing too much alcohol and you take in still more in any 
form, it'll make you too hot. 
 
"Zest Tonic" was a tonic developed by Carey Reams and was the closest substance to the alcohol manufactured by 
the pancreas that's ever been made.  It was made specifically to support and supplement the body's production of 
alcohol, but unfortunately it may no longer be available (See "Zest Tonic" in the "General Information" Section for a 
suggested recipe).  In its place other forms of alcohol may have to be used, like 94 proof gin, or even an alcohol 
based peppermint essence.  Sometimes a medium -dry, naturally fermented wine can be used but that too is a poor 
substitute.  The percentage of alcohol in Zest Tonic was 42% and by comparison the percentage of alcohol in pure 
vanilla is 35%.

Since the body uses sugar to make alcohol it follows that if th e sugar reading is too low, say less than 1.5, AND the 
body temperature is on the cool side then alcohol may need to be added to the diet.  Alcohol is used for anyone 
having: 
 indigestion, 
 heartburn, 
 gas, 
 cold hands and cold feet. 
 
Usually people that have a high pH will have gas, cramps, poor circulation, and if you are anaemic you'll have cold 
hands and feet then alcohol may have to be added to aid in the maintenance of body temperature and digestion, and 
in fact acute indigestion is related to the lack of pancreatic alcohol. 
 
I'll just explain something to you here and that is in your urine pH when it's up around 7.10 or 7.15 (Zone B say) and 
you have a 5.40 saliva pH, or even lower pH, then you have an ideal setting for acute indigestion.  Now people don' t 
have acute indigestion anymore they have heart attacks because there's no money in acute indigestion.  They can get 
acute indigestion well in 30 minutes, but it takes 2 weeks for a heart attack in a hospital and you can tell the 
difference between whether the patient is having a heart attack or whether they are having acute indigestion because 
with acute indigestion they have cold hands and cold feet.  Those are symptoms that let you know it's acute 
indigestion, cold hands and cold feet. 
 
In the case of acute indigestion or gas the fastest way to get relief and the thing that you can do is:  
 give them a teaspoon full of Zest Tonic, 94 proof gin, or half a teaspoon of pure peppermint essence, in 120 
ml (4 oz) of ordinary water, skim milk, grape juice, 7 Up, Coke, Sprite, or something like that and have them 
sip it, sitting up, slowly for 30 minutes.  Do not let the patient lay down, be sure they sit up and it's also a 
very good idea to pat them gently on the upper part of the back or use a vibrator on the bac k to help them 
burp, and when they start to burp they will get relief.  Don't beat them too hard and don't beat them to death, 
just a gentle pat will do very well, like burping the baby.  It's steady, like you're beating on a drum, but it has 
to shake the body and that'll cause the gas to be released. 
 
Now the cause of indigestion is only the gastric juices being too dilute to digest your food for whatever age you may 
be and the major cause of indigestion is not the combination of wrong foods or drinking wa ter with your meal.  The 
major cause of food not digesting, or indigestion, is hate, lack of love, emotional causes and remember this too, you 
cannot hate anyone else without first hating yourself.  Hate is the finest cancer seed on Earth.  If you want can cer 
just hate people and you're on the right track. 
 
Also interference with the regular way the heart beats, or heart skips, can be caused by a whole lot of things, 
including: 
 Your pancreas not manufacturing enough alcohol to control the body temperature,  
 there may not be enough arsenic in your foods.  Your heart has more arsenic in it than any other organ in the 
body and it can be a lack of arsenic, 
 it could also be that your calciums are too low and there is a nervous indigestion, or  
 it could be that you have a brain tumor, a 220 case. 
 
Also heart palpitations may come after you put someone on niacin, and if they start flushing immediately it means 
that they need it.  Now niacin does not lower the sugars but if they get a real bad flush with heart palpitat ions then 
the heart palpitation is caused by fear, not the nicotinic acid.  If they're told what to expect and what to do they don't 
get afraid and then they go through it nicely but if they are not told then they become afraid and it's the fear that 
causes heart palpitations. 
 
Now many times patients have complained about heart palpitations when they were not having heart palpitations, 
and even at the very minute they said they were, they were not.  What happened was that the pancreas had not 
manufactured enough alcohol and there was some gas in their stomach and as you pushed on one part of the stomach 
as the heart beat it buzzed another and then while the heart didn't beat then it moved back into the other place and 
made it feel like the heart was beating  twice as fast as it was when it was really just a shift in the pressure in the 
stomach.  It's a very annoying feeling but the heart is really beating an absolute perfect rhythm but it's like pushing

in on a pouch and pulling your hand out then the part yo u pushed in comes back out.  Now when you push in on the 
pouch in one place it pushes out in another, so actually you've got a sensation of a double beat there, a palpitation 
twice as hard when it isn't so at all, and anyone with a stethoscope and a good p ulse count can tell you the 
difference.  In these types of cases the alcohol can help here. 
 
For alcohol support, if the weight is 90 lb or over then mix 1 teaspoon full of Zest Tonic, or 94 proof gin, in 4 oz of 
either skim milk, grape juice, or whatever you have because you want it diluted down.  Have them sip it slowly for 
30 minutes because if they drink it quickly they'll not have accomplished anything, they must drink it slowly and 
when I say 30 minutes I don't mean 29 minutes, I mean 30 minutes. 
 
If someone has low blood sugar they can have fruit after 2.00 p.m. in the afternoon but in regard to alcohol, only 
about half the cases are cold and half are not.  On the cold ones the alcohol will do a terrific job if given as directed, 
that is sip it slowly for 30 minutes according to the pH. 
 
One more thing that you need to know if you're ever called to a person that's in a coma, or has every appearance of 
being comatose.  The first thing you do is to push your finger in on the calf of their leg, or their a rm muscle above 
their elbow, when you push your finger down into that muscle and lift it off and if that print stays in there get them 
to a hospital quickly, give them a teaspoon full of Zest Tonic directly, pour it into their mouth very slowly, and get 
them to a hospital quickly because they are in serious, serious condition.  
 
As to what happened, it could be a jillion things that happened, but one thing if you follow the rules of numbers it 
was nothing that you did in the numbers that really caused it, it  was their body got in withdrawal, and it probably 
saved their life if they survive it but it probably would have happened anyway if you'd have done nothing about it.  
 
In place of the Zest Tonic or gin, if you can't get it when you need it, you can use a n aturally fermented medium dry 
wine, it's not as good and is really a very poor substitute. 
 
Now don't be down on that which you're not up on.  One person came into Doc's office and said, "Doctor do you 
drink?  There's a bottle of wine here in your office." 
He said, "no, I don't drink, but I have patients sometimes with a bleeding nose.  They can't get their nose to stop 
bleeding and I have to have the wine quickly.  We get them to sipping on about 4 oz of ordinary medium -dry, 
naturally fermented grape wine and it stops the bleeding in a matter of fifteen minutes."  
 
People with a dark skin absorb more Vitamin D energy from the sun than people with a lighter skin, and the more 
Vitamin D that you absorb the more alcohol your body is apt to make.  One reason why the dark skinned man, the 
Negroid races, can be more relaxed than the white man, is because their systems manufacture more alcohol and they 
may be more sleepy all the time, so relaxed their sleepy.  It's been said the black races are afraid of work, in  fact 
they're not afraid of work at all, they can lay down and go to sleep right by it and many times it is the manufacture of 
pancreatic alcohol that causes a lack of initiative, or laziness, so to speak. 
 
While we're on the subject of alcohol we might as  well discuss inebriation, being intoxicated.  The alcoholic starts 
off to drink some alcohol, drink a little whiskey socially then it becomes more and more, more and more.  The first 
thing that alcohol does it begins to destroy too much of the calcium in the liver and then lack of calcium dilutes the 
gastric juice and then one of the first major elements to be lost is manganese, and then the lack of manganese 
initially causes the production of the least bit too much testrogen or oestrogen and then they bec ome addicted to 
something, because the least too much oestrogen or testrogen causes an addiction to something, and if it's alcohol it's 
alcohol, or pot, cigarettes, or anything, even white potatoes "I just cannot let it alone", then what happens next is th at 
the food that they put in their stomach is preserved in the alcohol, and it lays in the stomach, lays in the stomach, 
lays in the stomach and they burp and they burp and they burp and then some of them vomit it up and then they 
swear they'll never eat food again and they drink to get more energy, and around and around and around they go and 
they're very, very sick people.  
 
When you're faced with an alcoholic the first thing in the world to get an alcoholic off of alcohol is to get him to 
want to be deli vered, he needs a desire to co -operate and then once you do that then you start giving him calcium 
and it makes it much easier.  The AA is doing a fabulous job except that it's not coordinating diet with their program 
and when they do it's going to do a mu ch greater job in putting a great more zing behind the AA.  Now the patient's

got to want to do it and many times they're so nervous because of a lack of calcium available to their system that 
unless the first dose does it, it's no good.  The people need patience and education about how this system works. 
 
The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that alcohol was an illness and should be treated as an illness, and 
when the police pick up people that are inebriated they cannot put them in jail, they have to take them to a hospital 
and the hospitals don't want them. 
 
Insulin 
 
Insulin is a small (51 -Amino Acid) protein consisting of two amino acid chains linked by disulfide bonds and is the 
second thing produced in the pancreas, nature still following the l ine of least resistance.  Insulin's most prominent 
effect is to regulate the blood sugar levels: 
 Too much insulin means too little blood sugar, hypoglycaemia, and 
 Too little insulin means high blood sugar, hyperglycaemia. 
 
Where somebody has too much sugar  in the blood stream you should take them off of carbohydrates and starches 
almost immediately, including things like: 
 potatoes, 
 bread, 
 wheat products, 
 pies and cakes, etc.. 
 
Not only do these things raise the blood sugar level but can also cause the pancr eas to manufacture too much 
alcohol. 
 
If the pancreas is not manufacturing enough insulin and the sugar reading is below 5.49, and all of a sudden it starts 
to flush up an oversupply of insulin the sugar level drops quickly causing headaches.  
 
When a person's on insulin it also destroys the ability of the body to accept Vitamin C, but as you begin to correct 
the condition through diet and foods and dilute the insulin they use, you'll also need to supplement them with 
Vitamin C and it's the Vitamin C th at's actually doing the rebuilding job and not other substances within the food 
itself.  Foods rich in Vitamin C do a marvellous job in rebuilding the pancreas and body.  
 
If you find someone with a high sugar level and give a diet to fix their body chemist ry, and that chemistry responds, 
then they won't need to go on insulin.  So far there have been 100's of people every year that were supposed to go on 
insulin but refused and we got them to the point that they don't need to go on it.  Now it is a tailor -made diet for each 
individual and the only thing about it is it is not a cure -all, there isn't one thing that you do to everybody, it's all done 
according to the person's body chemistry.  You simply tailor make a diet to fit an individual according to his ne eds.  
Go by the numbers. 
 
The insulin you take is a drug that has never cured any disease, not even diabetes, and people should never be put on 
it to start with.  The only reasons why it would ever do any good would be:  
 cancer of the pancreas, or 
 cancer of the liver. 
 
And only then because the body couldn't supply the insulin, and even then the insulin would do very little good.  
 
To get someone off insulin depends on: 
 the effects they have, and 
 how much they've been taking and for how long. 
 
For instance, y ou need to know whether it's oxidised the blood vessels or not, and this would be a variable that 
would have to be determined for each individual, and also how much insulin they have been taking.  For people who 
want to get off of insulin we give them a diet to cause the pancreas to behave and to manufacture the right amount of 
insulin, but you have to be careful because over the years of taking insulin their systems have stored it up and their 
systems are like salted pork to the stage where it's hardened t heir arteries and veins and if they've been on it long

============================================================

============================================================

 
 
27 
enough to have crystallised the arteries and veins in their joints, in their kidneys and their brain then they're really in 
trouble.   
 
Now if they've not been on insulin too long and they're lucky, wh en their body starts to release this stored insulin 
then many times they begin vomiting and start to dehydrate, and in the mean time the insulin is still pouring into 
their system, released from their body actions, and then their platelets begin to drop be cause the insulin salt is too 
high in their blood and then you've got to get them into a hospital where they can have IV solutions in order to cut it 
down so it can pass out through the kidneys. 
 
If they're been on insulin for quite a while and the arterie s and veins are crystallised to the point of breaking and 
they're NOT so lucky then: 
 the arteries and veins may start breaking down in the joints causing excruciating pain in the joint, or  
 if it's a little more advanced, the arteries and veins may break in  the kidneys, causing the kidneys to break 
down and then they start passing blood, or 
 if it's still more advanced, the arteries and veins may break in the brain, they'll go into a coma, and you've lost 
a patient. 
 
So when you come to get a person off of insulin you've really got a problem on your hands. 
 
People that have been on insulin less than 10 years, and are taking less than 40 units, and have a high energy rating 
can be gotten off insulin providing they have a diet that will cause the pancreas to f unction normally.  Some of them 
go with no problem, and others you have to put them in the hospital as much as 3 times, but at no time do you ever 
take insulin away from anyone, and at no time do you recommend that they discontinue insulin.  Only the patie nt 
themselves or the physician that put them on insulin can take them off. 
 
The only ones we take on at the retreat to get their pancreas to function properly are those people that say they can 
tell when they have too much insulin, or not enough, and are a ble to regulate it themselves according to their tablets.  
We generally only work with those who use the short acting kind so that if they test through the day they can always 
add to it.  The long lasting insulin is unpredictable on how fast it's going bre ak and many times whenever this insulin 
turns loose in the muscle it does not turn loose at an even rate, for a while it'll turn loose with a very rapid rate and 
then it'll turn loose very slowly.  Testing needs to be done every hour of the day and night i n order to determine what 
their water intake and food intake should be, and there's been better than 80% success.  
 
For people that have been on heavy amounts of insulin for a long time do not take them off of food, they must have 
their food, but start lowering it down, it's all you can do.  I mean it's a touchy thing to do in the first place.  I've never 
seen a person yet that's needed to go on insulin in the first place. 
 
There was one person on 180 units a day and in three weeks he was off of it completel y, but during that time he 
couldn't walk 60 feet because it was effecting his heart and effecting his mind, and he was a fellow that absolutely 
was an abomination of abominations to be around because he was actually so sick he didn't realise what he was 
doing, kid stuff, acting like a 2 or 3 year old and was unaware of it and the public didn't excuse it at all.  But in the 
end you should have seen the complete change in personality, and he did it all by himself, he went off the insulin, 
took it off, and got  off it no problem whatever and his heart improved and he could walk a mile in just three weeks 
with no problem, and he couldn't even walk a 100 feet when he came in without his heart trying to pound out or 
skipping, jumping and it was insulin that upset it. 
 
The body will react the same way on the sugars, salts and ureas in that it will hang on and hang on then turn it loose 
and dump.  It often does that because they get stored up, and so does insulin (which is a salt), and this is why it's so 
dangerous for you to try to work with anybody with insulin because whenever you put them on a diet:  
 you don't take them off of insulin, and 
 you don't put them on a fast. 
 
During this time they have to regulate their insulin by the clinotest themselves, plus a suggesti on or two, because 
there'll be times when the body will release more insulin that's stored in the flesh than it does other days and they've 
got to adjust the clinotest and the diet and the food intake and the insulin all according to the insulin supply.

Now there are tell tale marks that a trained person can tell whether a person has too much or not enough insulin, for 
instance: 
 if their hands and arms are moist they don't have enough insulin, but 
 if they're dry and parched they have too much insulin. 
 
Now suppose you found that the left hand was moist and the right hand was dry or parched.  This happens because 
the dry side, right, has released too much insulin and the left hand side hasn't.  When that happens you do the best 
you can because in those cases  you need all the care and wisdom and knowledge and experience of the years and 
that's what you have to send them to the retreat for. 
 
Thyroxine 
 
Thyroxine is the third substance made in the pancreas, in other words, it's what's left over.  Now thyroxine goes into 
the blood stream and up to the thyroid organ (not gland, but organ) where the thyroid then adds potassium to it to 
form a substance like "old fashioned grandma's soap" that's there for the purpose of dissolving the excessive fats and 
oils in your system and keeps your weight to normal.  If it manufactures too much "old fashioned grandma's soap" 
then that's one cause for underweight, but if it doesn't make enough of it then you're overweight.  The thyroid organ 
also manufactures one of the potassiums needed for the brain. 
 
When you're looking at a card with the numbers on it the part that tells you about the thyroxine is the person's 
weight.  The "soap" takes the oil out of the system such that: 
 too much thyroxine, you're going a mile a minute, and you're going to have a less proportion of muscle to fat, 
in other words, you're going to be more lean, skin and bones.  In other words you end up being skin and 
bones because the ratio of muscle to fat has been thrown in the wrong direction and the oil tha t should be 
there is not there.  Remember this, lean by any given volume is four hundred times heavier than the same 
amount of fat.  Too much thyroxine means it's dissolved the body oils and fats and you've become thinner, 
more lean, but not necessarily de hydrated.  The dissolved oils and fats are being kicked out of the body and 
this kind of a person is a sinker, in other words, if they go to a swimming pool and try to float they're on the 
bottom. 
 too little thyroxine you start to become a little heavier, the fat starts to increase.   If you've got too little 
thyroxine you're going to have more fat to muscle. 
 
The T4 thyroxine molecule looks like this: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The T4 thyroxine molecule has two benzene rings and two atoms 
of iodine per ring. 
 There is also a T3 molecule that has three atoms of iodine, not four. 
 
You recognise a thyroid problem by: 
 overweight, or underweight, 
 or by a malfunctioning liver, by pH (saliva) being too high, 
 
that's some of the signs of it and the overall picture gives you an idea but there is no oversupply of such a thing as 
sugar or salt or whatnot and therefore to identify a thyroid problem you go by what we call deduction.  You deduct 
from your problem the possibilities of things that could cause certain symptoms or certain mineral losses.

Not enough thyroxine AND also not enough insulin go hand in hand when there's an overweight problem.  Now the 
body can have enough insulin or too much in sulin giving a low blood sugar reading and have not quite enough 
thyroxine and that can cause them to be overweight.  The reason that people don't lose weight is a malfunctioning 
pancreas.  If they're hypoglycaemic they've got too much insulin. 
 
All thyroid problems begin with a malfunctioning of the liver, and then the pancreas doesn't manufacture enough 
thyroxin and therefore the thyroid becomes irritated because it also supplies the material to rebuild itself and if it 
doesn't have that then you can have  all kinds of problems.  Hypothyroid or hyperthyroid just means a 
malfunctioning of the liver is the cause of the malfunctioning thyroid and it doesn't matter whether it's hyper, hypo 
or any other kind. 
 
Remember, when people are too thin their body makes too much "old fashioned grandma's soap" but you really need 
to see all the numbers, but get the calciums right and get them to slow down and rest.  Sometimes the cause of 
underweight may be a case of worms, but go by the numbers.  Now the converse of that,  too much weight, is 
covered elsewhere on the causes of overweight. 
 
It's all a matter of bringing balance to the system, the whole pattern you want to achieve body balance.  
 
Another thing that can happen with thyroxine is: 
 it can either be thrown out through the kidneys, or 
 it'll go into the blood stream and land in your stomach.  
 
If it gets into your stomach it's going to cause a little bit of nausea, maybe a little bit of roly poly but as far as the 
body chemistry is concerned there will be a loss of energy and it'll show in the saliva pH, for instance: 
 
 
 
 
pH Tests 
 
First  Second Third Fourth 
5.30  6.40 6.30 6.50 
7.50  7.50 7.50 7.50 
 
Over a 6 month period the range of the urine pH has improved, but the saliva pH didn't budge.  To change the saliva 
pH the person needs to slow down and rest.  As he said, "I haven't been able to bring my saliva pH down because 
I'm too active, I'm a goer, I'm a doer, I'm just going all the time, and the excess thyroxine lands in my stomach and 
it's effecting the digestive juices and I'm losing energy." 
 
It's showing a loss of energy and remember that the saliva is directional proportional to the gastric juices to start the 
mixing of your food.  So that's why when we're testing the saliva pH we're really testing the pH of t he liver bile.  To 
correct the situation with the thyroid so that it works right you've got to go back and work on strengthening the liver, 
providing oxygen, iron, iodine, water and so forth for the liver and bringing the whole body back into balance.  
 
Other Sugar Factors 
 
General 
 
Remember, what is food for one is a poison for another and if you'll read enough health books and do everything 
that every one of them says, you'll starve to death, because everyone is up on something and down on something 
else.  For instance, if you've read the health book on vinegar and honey you'd think that all in the world you need to 
be healthy, and live to be 150 years old, was to take vinegar and honey the way it's written.  But suppose that you 
had a body that was extremely acid and you were also a diabetic with it, hyperglycaemia, so into this system you put 
more acid and more sugar, that's pure foolishness and a shortcut to the undertaker.

In reading those type of books every cure -all would have to be extreme in order f or it to suit everybody, and it'd be 
just like cutting off your head to get rid of a headache.  Do you understand?  
 
What we're doing is taking the fads out of your diet and lifestyle and putting your health down in mathematical 
numbers, and we're going to go by the numbers. 
 
Abuse of Sugar.  It's the abuse of sugar that's wrong, not the use of sugar.  "What's wrong with white sugar?"  The 
abuse of it is wrong.  Two pounds a year is not going to hurt anybody.  It's the abuse of it.  The average American 
uses over 150 lb of white sugar a year. 
 
Allergy, Carbohydrate .   When we have some patients on the lemon juice and water, with sweetener, and their 
sugar reading keeps going down and down it indicates that the body has a problem handling one or more 
carbohydrates that they're having and that's generally an allergic reaction to certain specific kinds of carbohydrates, 
but not all kinds.  Find out which one they're allergic to and discontinue that one.  
 
Now the medical profession considers that a person that has  low blood sugar is allergic to all carbohydrates and they 
give high proteins and tell you to discontinue your carbohydrates but what we do is break all rules and find out why.  
We decrease their protein meats terrifically and put them into a low protein d iet, no protein substitutes, or anything 
of that nature and also put them on fruits and things, one at a time until you find out which fruit or which 
carbohydrates causes the pancreas to flush and then we discontinue that one and it solves the problem.  
 
Allergy, Honey.  Now lots of people are allergic to honey and an allergy to honey causes the pancreas to over flush 
and therefore it manufactures too much insulin, and the sugars go down but occasionally there will be too high a 
blood sugar.  Honey isn't classed as a hormone, it's an enzyme. 
 
Allergy, White Potatoes.  Doc Reams had a family come to him one time and there were seven children in the 
family, and the father and mother, and every one of them was in a diabetic zone.  He told them, "all of you folks  are 
allergic to white potatoes." 
And the mother almost died with shock, and said, "what else is there to eat?  We buy them by the 100 lb, what else 
is there to eat?" 
So he had to tell them what else there was to eat. 
 
Now rice, bread, wheat, and potatoes all effect the sugar reading. 
 
Carrot Juice.  Carrot juice is rich in vitamin A but you don't give carrot juice to anyone that is on sugar controlling 
drugs (insulin, diabinese, orinate or diabinate) because it is high in sugars.  Also carrot juice is an e xcellent thing for 
leukemia.  
 
Coma.  Suppose a person goes into a coma or seizure because of low blood sugar then you've got to have something 
close by and handy to help them.   Just keep your cool and tell them to put a little honey on their tongue, and i n one 
minute they'll be back. 
 
DES.  About cows and stilbesterol.  You know they still (in 1977) inject DES into animals in the USA, but not in 
Europe where it's illegal.  You inject this stuff into an animal to fatten it up, make it gain weight.  Now it w orks by 
effecting the thyroid which uses potassium to produce an oil emulsifier like "old -fashioned grandma's soap".  If you 
inject DES into an animal it interferes with the function of the thyroid and cuts down on the amount of "soap" that's 
produced and the effect is to increase the fat layer in the body of the animal because if the soap were there it would 
act to dissolve it. 
 
Dizzy.  When a person goes on a fast for maybe about 10 or 12 days he might become dizzy or light headed and this 
could be from either loss of potassium or low blood sugar or both. 
 
Energy From Foods.  It is the carbohydrates in foods that give you all your energy.  Remember, all of your energy 
comes from carbohydrates and carbohydrates are the sugars.  If the energy comes from carb ohydrates then the 
proteins transmit energy to the various parts of the body and store it also.  Proteins both transmit and store the

31 
energy, and if that were not true there would not be any such thing as an amino acid.  Amino acid stores protein and 
this is why the amino acid is so valuable to you. 
 
Frustrations.  Lack of calcium is one cause of frustrations, as is low blood sugar, high blood sugar, high ureas and 
so forth. 
 
Good Health.  Now there's a time for: 
 surgery, 
 drugs, 
 cherry pie, 
 a little wine with your food, 
 coffee, 
 a little bit of Gin 
 
and there is a time for most things, but there is no time for cigarettes or tobacco in any shape, form or way.  I have 
never seen a person yet that it benefited. 
 
Green Drink or Chlorophyll Drink. 
 
Green drink i s made by juicing edible green vegetables and is recommended for anyone that has a sugar problem, 
either too high or too low.  It helps the pancreas to make the right enzymes to regulate your insulin so it's good for 
high or low sugars.  One NO -NO about gr een drink and low blood sugar, never give comfrey, or comfrey tea, to 
people with low blood sugar because it lowers the sugar faster than anything else, but on all high blood sugar cases 
use it plentifully. 
 
Everybody should be getting green drink, and of course it depends on how much they weigh: 
 For a large person - 6 or 8 oz twice a day, 
 Average sized person - 4 oz twice a day, and 
 Small people or children - 2 oz twice per day. 
 
The usual amount is 4 oz twice a day. 
 
Green drink is one of the most perfect things you can take in: 
 it helps to either raise or lower the sugar level, 
 it works almost as a super charger to the liver, and 
 not to be overlooked, it is also a pain killer. 
 
There are many people who need a pain sedative, one to mask the pain, but it d oesn't mask as an aspirin does, it goes 
to the cause of what's causing the pain, cause and effect.  The raw chlorophyll in the green drink is one of the finest 
pain killers in the world and it begins to work on the whole system, and it's only after you've done a number of tests 
that you'll begin to see whether you recommended the proper amount or not.  In the retreats they give green drink 
like they're trying to change them into little green people but they're on top of the situation there and can monitor t he 
sugar levels but you cannot do that easily at home. 
 
When taking green drink, SIP IT SLOWLY.  Now sometimes it takes a day and a half to two days for it to work on 
the pain, but it works, and you can use the fresh chlorophyll with any pH.  The next thin g you can use is the bottled 
liquid chlorophyll, use it freely with all of your patients that have the urine pH over 6.40.  Now you can use a little 
in dilute form under 6.40, but go easy because it's a little on the cationic side.  
 
Green drink is made by juicing edible green vegetables like: 
 spinach, wheatgrass, celery, clover, lettuce, escarole, romaine, endive are excellent sources.  
 ordinary grass can be used, like Bermuda grass, Kentucky Blue grass and so on but make sure they're clean.  
Zoysia grass is different to Centipede grass or St. Augustine grass and is more in the class of Bermuda grass.  
It's good chlorophyll in there but it's also a very high protein grass.

Do not make it from collard type plants, cabbage, cauliflower leaves, broccoli leaves,  turnip green leaves and so 
forth because they're too strong, too rough. 
 
You can grind it in a food chopper, or use the old -fashioned sausage mill, or you can get an electric grinder then put 
it through a centrifuge and sling out the juice or just run it through a good juicer. 
 
Please DO NOT dilute it because you'd have to take too great a volume with a sick person.  
 
We use the raw chlorophyll from different plants for different things: 
 For low blood sugar it's OK to give chlorophyll from spinach, wheatgrass, celery tops, onion tops and so on.  
Do NOT give comfrey in cases of low blood sugar because comfrey really tumbles the sugars down.  
 For cases of real epilepsy, use the juice of "Centipede" or "St. Augustine" grasses.  Those are the ones that 
will do more for real epilepsy than any other grasses.  Generally they're not in health food stores, you have to 
get them out of your lawn or get them where there's a lawn that has them growing in it.  
 For Hodgkin's Disease, or cancer of the lymph glands, use  the chlorophyll from wheatgrass juice because it 
has a low protein value. 
 For MS we use spinach and comfrey, PROVIDING they don't have a low sugar.  
 For high blood sugar cases only, you use comfrey and you do not want to substitute comfrey tea for fresh 
comfrey in the green drink.  They can have comfrey tea extra.  If you cannot get the green comfrey to put in 
your green drink the comfrey tea is the next best thing. 
 
Headaches.  Now in the pattern shown below you've got someone that has headaches because he  has low blood 
sugar and the sugar number fluctuates, it goes downwards, and as it drops quickly they have headaches.  If it should 
drop slowly they don't have headaches, if it goes down quickly they do, so this would denote headaches.  The urine 
pH factor has to be in an alkaline range to give you the headaches though.

Healing.  Now this is something that is really not clarified in many medical texts but healing will not take place 
without enough oxygen, not because the blood sugar's too high.  It's the lack of oxygen that prevents our healing and 
so people will rub vitamin E in and they'll do everything else they can think of on their sores and cuts and for some 
people it may help and other people it won't. 
 
Lips, Blue.  If the lips are showing blueness it's an oxygen deficiency. 
 
Overweight.  There's a whole lot of factors to be considered with your sugar reading and your weight and we'll just 
cover a few of those because it does have a direct bearing on your sugar readings.  For instance there's a number of 
reasons for overweight: 
 Obesity is only one and that only covers about 2% of the people even at that number.  I even probably think 
it's lower than that. 
 Many times people eat, and eat, and eat because they're so bored with life. 
 Your liver manufactures a substance called glycogen.  The glycogen goes over to the pancreas and it makes 
thyroxin, and the thyroxin then goes up to the thyroid and the thyroid mixes potassium with it and then you 
have a type of "old fashioned grand ma's soap", that's there for the purpose of dissolving the excessive fats 
and oils in your system and keeps your weight to normal.  If it manufactures too much old fashioned 
grandma's soap then that's one cause for underweight, but if not enough of it then you're overweight. 
 Another cause of overweight is what we've just mentioned, the sugar imbalance, the sugar was out of ratio, 
there were too many carbohydrates, your body was retaining too much sugars.  
 The third thing is insulin.  The taking of insulin so  many times increases weight, or an excessive salt in the 
system can often cause an increase in weight. 
 Another cause of weight is lack of calciums, nervousness, that can cause an overweight.  
 There's also a genetic reason, in other words you will generally  look like, or fat people will, their ancestor 
that they wished they didn't look like because of their overweight.  Their grandfather, grandmother, mother or 
father, uncles or aunts, you'll generally look like one of them you wished you didn't.  Especially  by the time 
you become to be a senior citizen.  Now you may or may not but I'm just talking about those that are

overweight.  Now if it's a genetic condition there's not anything you can do about it.  
 Also the birth control pill has effected many people, i t's thrown their weight out of all proportion and it's one 
of the causes of an imbalance in your body's ability to control sugar and your fat content.  
 
Pregnancy 
 
Keep the sugar level on pregnant women above 1.4.  Miscarriages or premature labor pains are always caused 
because of low sugar and the finest thing in the world to do to prevent premature labor pains is put the expectant 
mother to bed for a few days and give her 4 ounces of medium dry grape wine once or twice a day and that will 
delay labor pains and bring the child on through to normalcy. 
 
Morning sickness may be caused by: 
 low blood sugar, 
 low calciums, especially phosphate of calcium, or 
 too much difference between the pH of the urine and the pH of the saliva.  In other words it creates a lot o f 
gas while they're sleeping and the little bit of gas with the pressure of pregnancy causes quite a lot of distress.  
 
So these are rather easy to handle is the low blood sugar causing a nausea or sick feeling.  
 
If the uterus is in such bad shape that you would lose the mother and the child then you have the means to bring 
about a natural abortion.  Lower the blood sugar intentionally and keep it below a total of 1.0 for 3 to 5 days and the 
foetus will die and then labor pains will start and then you can gi ve them a small amount of wine to get them into a 
hospital. 
 
If it's a first child you won't have to give them the wine because the labor pains will be far enough apart that you've 
got time but they may come in at 3 minutes apart then you need to give them wine until they get to the hospital.  4 
ounces of wine will delay the labor pains until you get them in the hospital and then the baby c an be delivered.  
Unless there is a reason to save a mother's life I will not use that method. 
 
This method works because a foetus uses 300 to 500 percent more oxygen than you or I do, and if you cut that 
oxygen low enough the foetus dies - and that's a natural abortion, but I do not use that and never have and never will 
only as a means of last resort to save the mother's life because if the uterus is in such bad shape that it could rupture 
causing both the mother to lose her life and the foetus' life also then it's justifiable. 
 
So these are things that you need to know and need to use.  Now I ask you, humanitarianly, not to do it unless there 
is a reason and you should not attempt it unless you're a doctor or a chiropractor or someone that your State perm its 
you to do this.  Put them into a retreat, or put them into a hospital where this can be done under control because 
there's quite a very narrow margin there you've got to work with because you want to lower the sugar content in the 
blood low enough that the mother will not become comatose or unconscious and yet cause the foetus to die for lack 
of oxygen. 
 
One of the indications that the mother's life is in danger is high delta cells in the uterus, or the upper vagina, or the 
entire uterus, vagina and ovary area in the lower pelvis. 
  
We had a woman, 41/2 months pregnant, come in last August and she was having labor pains when they brought her.  
The couple wanted their baby, they did not want it to abort and she still had about 4 months to go.  
 
We immediately ran a sugar test and found it was 0.8 brix, so we immediately took dietary steps to raise the sugar 
above 1.0 and after a week and a half we got it up to 1.6 or 1.7 and finally got it to around 2.0 at which we kept it.  
 
The baby, a boy, was delivered o n Christmas Eve and the parents did a terrible thing, they named it after me.  Poor 
little fellow, what did he do to deserve that to start with? 
 
The sugar level was raised with lots of fruit and honey every half hour and we also gave her 4 oz of medium dr y 
wine twice a day between meals.  This is what we did in order to keep the sugar level up, and it's a very beautiful 
little boy.

Retreat Case.  Anyone with a sugar that is constantly below 1.2 should be in a retreat and you should not give them 
a diet.  If you give them a diet you're taking an unnecessary risk that you shouldn't take because there's one or two 
critical things you do not know: 
 You do not know whether it's the person's diet, or not the diet, that is causing the pancreas to flush too much,  
 You do not know at what hour the flushing takes place, or 
 Whether it's a day thing, or whether it happens through the night. 
 
It is possible that if you give a diet to a person that has a tendency to extremely low blood sugar then after they go to 
bed at night as usual, during the night the pancreas may flush causing them to go into a low oxygen coma and 
nobody would be there to help them.  Now if they go into a coma with lowered oxygen to the brain then in the space 
of a few hours, if they even survived it, they would be a vegetable. 
 
Now if you have this type of extremely low blood sugar case and the person must stay at home, with no chance for 
them to come to a retreat, they should have someone sleep with them; someone who they can call or who can check 
on them at least every half hour.  It doesn't do much harm for a person to be in a low blood sugar coma for up to two 
hours but after that great damage could be done to the brain. 
 
Now generally when a person's body chemistry, like the sugar content, start s to lower real quickly, they generally 
can let somebody know that they need help and to get somebody, especially if they're laying down and taking it 
quite easy.  They begin to feel very badly and they wake up, they know something's not right and they may  call out, 
"nurse" or, "somebody, help".  This is why we need to have them in the retreat where there is care on call if this 
happens. 
 
Starch.  Starches and carbohydrates are not the same thing, somebody was trying to tell me that starches turned into 
sugar, throw that out, it's not true, it won't work and it'll be proved later. 
 
Another way of talking about alcohol production in the pancreas is that in the liver it is the starches, carbohydrates 
and fats and oils that give up the sugars, not the proteins.  The starches act as a catalyst to collect and hold the sugars 
much like a sponge and this is where your carbons come in. 
 
Now to achieve this there is a loss of energy in the liver for if there were no loss of energy in the body then life 
would not be possible.  Now the liver in its many manufacturing jobs produces about 6 billion different enzymes and 
some of these enzymes manufacture the 94 proof alcohol (47%) in the pancreas from the starches, carbohydrates, 
fats and oils.  The alcohol then is used in a mechanism to control heat in the body.  Now one drop of the alcohol 
produced by the pancreas will control the body temperature in a 100 lb body for about 1/2 an hour. 
 
Sugar.  When we talk about sugar we're not talking about white sugar or brown sugar, we're talking about the 
natural form of complex carbohydrate out of the plant before it's processed, in the sugar cane itself for that matter.  
Now the problem with a high or low sugar reading is that it means a lack of oxygen.  A "correct" sugar level act ually 
holds and transfers oxygen but a high or low reading means you build up oxygen debt.  
 
Sugar is a chelate because it becomes a binder for oxygen transfer, it grabs onto the oxygen to hold it in on a transfer 
basis, and in our system this is why the su gar's important, as a transfer mechanism.  Now in the equation of cause 
and effect and the relationship of foods, the sugar range of between 1 to 2 is the place of our ideal balance, where we 
get our ideal oxygen transfer. 
 
It may be interesting that medic al research says that if the brain goes without oxygen for about 4 minutes there's 
permanent damage.  Now there's some people doing research on this when they saw people who had been 
comatosed for 35 and 40 minutes and brought out without absolutely any br ain damage at all.  In doing the research 
on it they're finding now that what's important is not the fact that the oxygen can't get to the brain but the brain 
metabolism centred around sugar at the time.  If you have a proper sugar level in the system your  brain will survive 
quite a while without oxygen. 
 
In other words people who are partying and indulging and carrying on and all of a sudden they get exposed to a 
drowning situation and their possibility of surviving past three to four minutes is really low , and if those people have

good balance of sugars within their system it seems their possibility of surviving goes way beyond that 3 or 4 
minutes. 
 
Symptoms, High Blood Sugar & Low Blood Sugar.   The symptoms of high blood sugar and low blood sugar are 
identical. 
 
Water Consumption with Low Sugar & High Ureas.   There are times when you shouldn't drink the water that 
you're supposed to, for instance, suppose you had low blood sugar, and you had a high ureas, and you started to 
drink water, then you'd go into a coma. 
 
So if you have high ureas, and a low sugar, then you're going to have to use lemonade or some other juice along 
with it in order to get the ureas down and many times if it's a juice it's going to draw the ureas from your own fat 
until they won't drop down.

pH of the URINE and SALIVA 
 
 
 
pH AND RESISTANCE 
 
 
 
Rule. No number is "perfect" unless all numbers are "perfect".  "Perfect" pH is 6.40 over 6.40, when, and only 
when, ALL numbers are perfect. 
 
Rule. The pH of the saliva equals that of the liver bile.  That's very close to constant and, most of the time, 
absolute. 
 
Rule. The slower the digestion the higher the urine pH and the higher the pH the greater the bowel congestion.   
 
Rule. Keep your instruments and your equipment absolutely clean and properly adjusted. 
 
Rule. The greater the specific gravity of a mineral the less likely the body is to take it the more dilute the gastric 
juices become.  In other words, the more dilute the gastric juices the less mineral any one can get out of their 
food, and the less mineral they get out of their food the less energy they get on the frequency that they need 
and consequently the very energy that they need is passing out of their system undigested.  
 
Rule. There are two extremes that bring about r esistance, 0 and 14 and somewhere between 0 and 14 is your line 
and measure of resistance.  7 is said to be neutral. 
 
Rule. Any number that deviates from it's perfect means a loss of energy, and the more the deviation the greater the 
loss of energy. 
 
Rule. The urine specimen is only good for about an hour.  After an hour the tests lose their real meaning because 
the bacteria in the specimen change it. 
 
Rule. Calcium is needed more by weight and volume than any other mineral. 
 
Rule. When the resistance is lo w the ionization is high, and when the resistance is high the ionization is low, just 
like a see saw, see sawing up and down.

pH 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Søren Peder Lauritz Sørensen (9 Jan 1868–12 Feb 1939) was a Danish chemist at the Carlsberg Laboratory in 
Copenhagen, and the term "pH" was first used by him.  In 1909 Sorensen published a paper in Biochem Z in which 
he discussed the effect of H1+ ions on the activity of enzymes.  In the paper he invented the term pH ("p" was taken 
from "potenz", the Danish word for "power", "activity" or "resistance", and "H" stands for hydrogen) to describe this 
effect and defined it as the -log[H1+ ]. In 1924 Sorensen realized that the pH of a solution is a function of the 
"activity" of the H1+ ion not the concentration and published a second paper on the subject. A better definition would 
be pH=-log[aH1+ ], where aH1+ denotes the activity of the H1+ ion. The activity of an ion is a function of many 
variables of which concentration is one, and the concentration of hydrogen ions was determined by measuring the 
current generated in an electrochemical cell when the ions migrate to oppositely charged electrodes. Sørensen used a 
negative logarithm of the hydrogen concentration to create a scale from 0-14, where a pH of less than 7 is an acid, 7 
is neutral and higher than 7 is an alkali. So water has a pH of 7, lemon juice 2.4 and bleach 12.5. The pH of beer is 
4.5.  
 
In simple terms, pH is a measure of the resistance of substances as compared to the hydrogen ion, and hydrogen was 
used because it's a simple ion with a ratio of 1 anion to 1 cation. 
 
Carey Reams may have set up the first pH system that was ever in existence, using his own pH system for 7 or 8 
years before the current system was introduc ed.  The system he devised went from 0 to 12 but when he came across 
the later system, ranging from 0 to 14, he preferred, and used that one. 
 
The current pH system is based on a logarithmic scale and the end points were determined by taking sulfuric acid, 
H2SO4 (the father of all acids) at the most cationic end at 00.  This is the greatest resisting thing that there is in all 
chemicals on the cation side, there is nothing that has greater cationic resistance than this.  On the other extreme, the 
highest one in the anionic field is calcium and calcium hydroxide in its purest form is at the other end at 14.  
 
So 0 - 14 is the pH range in which you're working and with 7 as the neutral point, scientists consider that:  
 all substances with a pH less than 7 are  acidic, and 
 all substances with a pH greater than 7 are alkaline or basic. 
 
Under the principles of biological ionization the pH is considered to be a MEASURE OF RESISTANCE between 
anions and anions, cations and cations or anions and cations as compared with the hydrogen ion.  It's a measure of 
resistance; it's not a volumetric reading and unless you can keep that fact in mi nd you can be led astray very easily.  
The difference between acid and alkaline is considered in a new light: 
 acid is cationic and the electrons in the outer shell travel counter clockwise, and  
 base is alkaline is anionic and the electrons in the outer shell travel clockwise. 
 
In view of these more precise atomic definitions it means that hydrochloric acid is not really an acid, it's a base 
because the electrons in the outer shell travel clockwise and that also has everything to do with the body's digestion  
of food.  Remember this, in all of our foods there's only three alkaline, or anionic, elements:  
 Potassium, 
 Calcium, and 
 Chlorine. 
 
We'll break your first fad right here, remember this, all foods are cationic with the exception of lemonade, (fresh 
squeezed lemon juice, water and sweetener).  Carey Reams tested over 1/4 million different species and over 16,000 
different kinds of things that people could eat and found only one anionic food, lemonade, all the rest were cationic.  
The electrons rotate clockwise in lemons, regardless of the type of lemon. 
 
Now it's perfectly possible that there's another food somewhere that's anionic that has not been identified as being 
anionic.  It's all in the direction of rotation of the electrons.

Now pH is a measure of resistance and it is the resistance in our body that gives us energy, and the various forms of 
energy are like the parts of a jig saw puzzle that are put together to form the micronage or molecule, and they are in 
such great proportions until you can 't express them in numbers.  As well as being a measure of resistance the pH is 
also the factor that determines: 
 Which calciums our body is deficient in; and the pH readings of 6.40 over 6.40 is perfect when, and only 
when, all other numbers are perfect. 
 The strength of our gastric juice, which then determines how heavy our diet should be (baby food or meats or 
nuts or other heavier foods). 
 Which kind of calcium our liver needs most for the manufacture of hydrochloric acid in our stomachs.  
 
The pH factor ca n be related to the speedometer of a car, it lets you know at what rate the foods are digesting.  The 
pH tells how fast the electrons are travelling in the foods that are trying to be digested, and whenever that speed gets 
down to the speed of your frequency then it is energy that you can live upon.  
 
pH is also shows the measure of resistance in soils, and the calciums that are needed to maintain our perfect health 
in life goes back to the responsibility of the farmer, and he hasn't been taught anything but to put lime on the ground, 
because there's no money in lime, it's only about 8 dollars a ton delivered, and many times they'll apply it on your 
farm for that much.  Now the experiment station tells you that if you have a low pH you need calcium in your  soil 
and if you have a high pH you don't need calcium in your soil, and that's the biggest lie that was ever told.  For 
instance, pure water with a pH of 7.0 has no acid, no alkaline and no calcium in it.  Pure white builder's sand has a 
pH of 7.0 and als o has no acid, no alkaline and no calcium in it.  You get the idea, so how can they tell the public 
that a pH reading will denote whether you need calcium or don't need calcium.  The experiment station staff are a 
bunch of idiots and the farmer's gullible enough to believe it, and cry all the way to the bank, broke!  Broke, because 
pH is a measure of resistance and not a measure of volume. 
 
There's plenty of times that soils can have a pH of 8.0 and be deficient in calciums.  Following is the ratio in tonna ge 
for agricultural purposes and you can figure it out about the same ratio for people.  If you had 2000 kg of pure white 
builder's sand and you add 50 kg of lime, mix it absolutely equal throughout you'd have 2050 kg by weight.  If you 
then added 1 kg of flowers of sulfur and mix it absolutely equal you'd still have a pH of 7. 
 
Now suppose that in one hectare you had 50 kg of calcium and 1 kg of sulfur and it had a pH of 7.  In another 
hectare you added 100 times the amount and had 5000 kg of calcium and 100 kg of sulfur you'd still have a pH of 7. 
 
Now which would make the best crop, the one with 50 kg of calcium per hectare, or the one with 5000 kg of calcium 
per hectare considering that plants have more calcium in them than any other one element?  
 
When y ou consider the value of a chart showing the pH on various foods you'll come to realise it's worthless 
because you'll not know the actual pH of a food you're eating, whether it's a 4 or 14,  and that's the reason the chart 
is worthless.  Now, if every peac h had exactly the same pH range, or every orange had the exact same one, then it 
would be easy, but they don't.  For instance, you have Valencia oranges that are so acid till you can't eat them, and 
others that are so sweet until they taste like honey.  For instance, I've seen the same variety of peach with: 
 a 10 brix sugar that were sweet and delicious, because it had a number 4 acid, but  
 a 16 brix sugar AND a 14 acid and they were so sour you couldn't eat them.  
 
and that's the reason I said the chart was worthless. 
 
pH, Resistance & Ionization 
 
Resistance and ionization are like a see-saw: 
 A high pH indicates a high resistance and a low ionization, and 
 A low pH indicates a low resistance and a high ionization. 
 
 
 
MEASUREMENT OF pH 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================
PAGE 38
============================================================

Colourmetric Measurement. 
You need to be able to discern between different shades of similar colours to be effective at this.  
 
Chemicals.  The chemical reagents used in the measurement of pH are: 
Bromcresol Green for pH between 3.8 and 5.4 
Chlorphenol Red  for pH between 5.2 and 6.8 
Bromthymol Blue for pH between 6.0 and 7.6 
Phenol Red  for pH between 6.8 and 8.4 
 
Method.  Using a well plate, put one drop of urine into a well and add one drop of a chemical reagent, starting with 
the Bromthymol Blue.  Take the reading of f the colour chart.  Repeat the procedure with the next indicated 
chemical.  Repeat until an accurate reading is achieved. 
 
Repeat the procedure for the saliva. 
 
Do NOT read the colour by fluorescent light because it's very, very poor.  Use natural, full s pectrum light if you can, 
or even a bright incandescent, but try to avoid fluorescent light. 
 
If the equipment is not clean it may give you a lower pH reading than it really is.  To be sure the well plate is clean 
you can check it with the Chlorphenol Red.   Have some in a container and pick that up with a pipette, and if the 
Chlorphenol Red changes colour in the pipette then it isn't clean.  When you drop it onto your plate and it begins to 
change colour around the edge and if you swish it around a little bit it'll contaminate showing the plate isn't clean. 
 
If it doesn't change colour put it back into your small container.  Regardless, the plate and pipette again go through 
the water bath then the alcohol bath. 
 
pH Meter 
 
On your pH meter you know you need to check the accuracy of your reading several times with your buffer 
solutions, and don't let it get out of range.  As well as keeping the meter correctly adjusted you also need to keep the 
probe and vials clean or you're going to get the wrong reading.  N ow the best thing to do is put the probe into 
distilled water and see if you get a zero reading, and if it is, it's clean. 
 
Read and follow the operating instructions for the meter. 
 
pH Range 
 
The pH is measured on both the urine and saliva and the test ra nge is from about 4.80 to 8.20, and a reading of 6.40 
is the mid range, or perfect, or neutral  (on the scientific scale, a reading below 7.00 is said to be acidic and a reading 
above 7.00 is alkaline).  Consequently: 
 4.80 to 6.39 is low pH or acid, and 
 6.41 to 8.20 is high pH or alkaline. 
 
If you have a pH reading above 9.0 or below 4.5 then it is likely that the reading is incorrect and you'll need to check 
the cleanliness and accuracy of your equipment. 
 
pH and Energy 
 
A pH reading shows how fast the ele ctrons in the undigested food is travelling, or in the food that is trying to be 
digested, and whenever that electron speed gets down to the speed of your frequency then it is energy that you can 
live upon. 
 
Basically any time both pH's move away from perf ect the person is experiencing a loss in energy and a loss in 
energy generally effects the digestive juices and digestion and hence there will be a mineral imbalance.

Remember, a movement of the pH away from perfect, either up or down, indicates a loss of  calcium. 
 
Calcium 
 
There can be no discussion about resistance in the body without talking about calcium because there is more calcium 
in the body by weight and volume than any other mineral, and what makes calcium available?  Resistance.  
 
For instance, in soils and agriculture how much calcium is available to your crop is determined by the amount of 
resistance that you create in the soil and the same thing occurs in the body, the amount of energy that your body gets 
is determined by: 
 The quantity of resistance.  How much resistance there is in the body and the food. 
 The quality of the resistance.  The kind of energy patterns in the food and whether you need them, and  
 The kind of resistance you need. 
 
Lack of calcium is the PRIMARY cause of the degeneratio n of any organ in the body, and oxygen is the 
SECONDARY cause, and then it follows through with a number of other minerals.  
 
At this stage there will not be a detailed discussion on calcium, just sufficient to introduce the topic.  
 
Under the study of Biolo gical Ionization there are 7 different kinds of calcium, and one kind is not available to 
human beings: 
 Calcium Hydroxide (Not suitable for Human Beings as a hydroxide) 
 Calcium Oxide, 
 Calcium Carbonate, 
 Tricalcium, 
 Calcium Phosphate, 
 Calcium Sulphate (Gypsum), and 
 Dolomite (not available to human beings as a source of calcium). 
 
The electrons in calcium always travel clockwise and therefore calcium is always anionic, or alkaline, and there's no 
exception.  Now in a test tube it doesn't always appear to be that way but calcium is always an anionic substance, 
anywhere, anytime, anyplace, on the bottom of the ocean, in the ocean water, in the soil, in a seashell, or anywhere 
else, and that is constant.  The calcium is an anionic substance because the electrons in orbit always rotate 
clockwise.   
 
Because the body contains more calcium  by weight and volume than any other mineral, it means that an 
insufficiency of calciums means a dilution of the gastric juice.  A dilution of the gastric juice means that less mineral 
is taken from the foods you eat and when you get less mineral than you should it means that some tissue somewhere 
in your system is going to be starving for mineral, meaning that it's cells cannot be replaced on time and are going to 
become carcinoma, and may even turn to cancer if those needs are not supplied. 
 
Saliva pH 
 
The saliva pH and the pH of the liver are the same and the pH is the strength of the hydrochloric acid made by the 
liver.  The greater the saliva pH is away from perfect the more dilute and weaker the gastric juice.  For instance, if 
the saliva pH is too low , indicating the liver is too acid, you're not getting the energy you need from the food 
because it's turning it too rapidly into anionic and cationic heat, or electricity, and it's passing out of your body.  
 
According to Doc, the saliva pH basically indic ates how much in tune the mouth and the stomach would be with the 
digestive juices that have been given out.  The greater the difference between the urine and saliva pH the more of a 
challenge you're facing because the greater is the heavy mineral deficien cy.  For instance, you'll see some people 
with a 4.8 over 7.2 and you really have a challenge facing you.  Generally we adjust the urine pH and the saliva pH 
falls into range. 
 
The greater the difference between the anionic and the cationic substances, the  greater the amount of gas is formed, 
in other words, if the saliva is the exact pH of the liver bile then it coats the food that we chew and swallow and

therefore the action of the digestion on the food that we eat, or its conversion into usable energy, i s rather slow to 
start with because if it was not slow a lot of gas would be created and need to be expelled.  The greater the 
difference in the pH between the foods we eat, and the saliva, and the gastric juice, the greater the amount of gas that 
is formed down to the caecal valve of the small intestine.  After the caecal valve then gas is passed out through the 
rectum.  If the food lies too long in the colon it gives off CO 2 gas and creates cramps and pockets and difficulties in 
the colon. 
 
There's other factors besides saliva pH involved in the equation and unless these other factors are evident there's no 
use to run a saliva pH every time.  If the person is doing their program at home and coming in once every 2 weeks or 
3 weeks the saliva should be teste d every time, but with daily testing in a retreat or at home it is not necessary to do 
a saliva every day.  For instance, some test cards may show a reading over X, reading over X, reading over X, day 
after day, or 2 or 3 times a day.  So by implication they're putting more emphasis on a consistent urine reading rather 
than on the saliva. 
 
Sometimes you'll have a low saliva reading that you'll have a very, very difficult time in getting it to rise.  You can 
do everything in the book you can think of and it just about won't rise and generally (because I'm not aware of any 
exception) in those cases the reason is that the liver is not getting enough oxygen from the lungs.  In order to change 
this around the person must do absolutely nothing for weeks, and weeks , and weeks.  By this I mean practically 
nothing except go to the bathroom, walk slowly around the block, or walk slowly for about 400 metres in the 
morning, maybe 800 metres a little later, but very slowly, because if the saliva does not respond by rising  it's a lack 
of oxygen is the cause of it. 
 
A lack of oxygen from emphysema would be one cause, another probable reason would be damage to the vagus 
nerve between the main trunk and the liver, or a brain tumor.  The lowest reading known to have been seen w as 4.60 
and the person was still living.  Whenever the reading goes really low and stays there long enough they have 
diarrhoea, and if it gets high above normal then they may have slow digestion. 
 
Sometimes you'll have an extremely lower reading on the sal iva, high reading on the urine pH and next test the pH's 
have flipped.  When you find an extremely rapid change in the pH of the saliva, which is the liver, and the pH of the 
urine be sure that it's not an equipment problem because it doesn't generally hap pen, the pH of the saliva generally 
changes slowly although once in a great while it may change quickly.  If it flips upward it's excellent, but if it flips 
downwards you're losing a patient and real fast. 
 
So it's very uncommon for the pH's to flip when y ou have really clean equipment but it can and does turn downward 
quickly sometimes if your patient starts to pass.  Most of the time it's the equipment not being clean, so be sure it's 
clean.  It'll take you more time to clean the equipment than it does to do the test. 
 
Now let's suppose that the hydrochloric acid had become too alkaline, too much of a base, way up high in the pH.  
What would happen?  The food would digest too slowly, constipation would set in and then they need colonics.  So 
the food would be digesting way too slowly and they'd have constipation with a lot of gas and misery.  Constipation 
is the major cause for hypertension in children, they're miserable, the food is not digesting.  
 
Now for a high alkaline system you can get the Calcium Lactate in shots. 
 
Alcohol in excessive amounts is the greatest enemy calciums ever had and alcohol dilutes or destroys the gastric 
juice by the destruction of the calcium in the liver, in other words, the more calcium that's destroyed in the liver the 
more dilute the gastric juice and some people's own system manufactures too much alcohol and this still causes the 
gastric juice to be too dilute. 
 
Urine pH 
 
When the pH is: 
 above 6.40 it is calcium oxide that caused it to be there.  Whenever the body gets too much calcium oxide for 
too long a time then the calcium oxide displaces the lesser calciums. 
 high, say high 7.0's, there is slow, poor digestion and the colon is not getting clean and the reason is the food 
being eaten is too rich and too heavy for the gas tric juice that's manufactured by the liver.  So it relates to the

41 
liver and the liver functioning.  You would recommend a colonic. 
 below 6.40 it is the lack of calcium oxide that caused it to be there, and if the pH is well below 6.40 then you 
want a calcium oxide or calcium carbonate or a tri-calcium in order to build it up. 
 
The urine pH is the major guiding factor, take care of that carefully and accurately and generally the saliva pH will 
eventually come into line.  Now there are some side steps to tha t and it is not a rule to go by because the saliva pH 
tells what's going on and what kind of foods to have.  Although you're mostly concerned about the urine pH reading, 
it's the liver calcium that you really want to take care of.  Give calcium according t o the lowest reading but you may 
also need to give calcium lactate according to your highest reading in order for the resistance to create more energy.  
So there are times when you would actually administer both calcium oxide and calcium lactate.  
 
General Effects 
 
Rising pH.   The higher the urine pH into the upper 6's, 7's, 8's the effect is directly on the liver activities, it's 
malfunctioning or it's toxic and we have to watch for that because the liver effects may then spill off into the 
pancreas and eve ntually even spilling over into the ureas.  So do not look at just one number by itself because "no 
number stands by itself."  You cannot look at one number and build a case on it, you can for a short time but then 
you have to tie it into other parts of the equation. 
 
Falling pH.  The lower the urine pH quite often you're referring to the bowel, its function and the fact that the bowel 
is becoming more toxic.  There's putrefaction in the bowel and the body is reabsorbing all types of toxins and that in 
turn effects the liver.  It's a vicious cycle that you have to break because the pH reflects the strength of the bile and 
the digestive juices and if you cannot digest the food it begins to putrefy in the bowel and you reabsorb the toxins 
from the bowel.  That  then effects the liver and the liver then can't do its task properly of making the bile and the 
digestive juices the right strength and you go round and round.  It's our task to break that cycle using foods and 
minerals.  Remember, when the resistance is low the ionization is high, and when the resistance is high the 
ionization is low and we need to maintain a balance between resistance and ionization. 
 
Once you clean up the liver and sort out the bowel most allergies will leave. 
 
Balancing pH's 
 
The pH ba lance between the urine and saliva may be all right as far as the balance is concerned but there still may 
not be enough hydrochloric acid to do the job. 
 
The main point you need to remember is that "the liver is the key organ that we work at."  The liver is in the driver's 
seat and when it comes to balancing the pH's there's a reason for trying to balance it quickly.  If you don't give 
properly absorbed calciums by the mouth the body will continue to take the calciums from the body itself to sustain 
life, and that leaching brings about: 
 Osteoporosis.  If the body takes calcium from the bones, if it leaches it out of the bones you're creating a 
situation called osteoporosis which simply means that the calciums are not being absorbed from the food and 
the body is taking from the body to sustain life, and 
 Osteoarthritis.  The leaching of the bone can only go on so long and once it's happened for a period of time, 
or it happens at the joint areas, now it's called osteoarthritis.  Over a period of time you have t hin bones and 
weak joints.  This happens with people who are quite old, you always hear about people who fall and break 
their hip, and it takes them months and months and months to try and heal, this is their problem.  The 
osteoarthritis. 
 
UpH - 8.2 Constipation. pH 8.2 describes constipation because the food is digesting too slowly.  The 
slower the digestion the higher the pH and the higher the pH the greater the bowel 
congestion.   
 
UpH - 8.1 
 
UpH - 8.0 Cirrhosis  At about 8.0 there is terrific stress on the liver and you can have cirrhosis and that 
type of liver damage set in.

Calcium Deposits. At 7.4 they're beginning to have calcium being deposited, I want to say 
randomly but that's not right because the body doesn't do anything just at 
random.  It pic ks out very specific spots which are out of the way, normally 
called joints, and they start to deposit calcium there.  So you have calcium 
deposits or calcium spurs.

UpH - 7.2 Gallstones.  At 7.2 and above you're in the gallstone area, 
 
Cal II.  The reason you use cal II up to 7.20 is that you also use Vitamin C, which is highly acid, 
and if you didn't use cal II in all probability the pH would drop below 6.40 and then the Vitamin C 
would not be available to you. 
 
Sex Organs .  At 7.2 are effected again with both men and women and many men at this point

UpH - 6.7 Slow Digestion.  Anyone having pH say over 6.60 you'd want to recommend prune juice.  I 
usually write down take four ounces first thing in the morning mixed with 4 oz of hot water.  So 
anyone that has any kind of colon problem it would be a good idea to recomm end that they have 
prune juice in the hot water drink the first thing in the morning, either six ounces or eight ounces, 
depending on how big they are.  First thing when they get up even before they have their either 
morning coffee or anything.  Make a hot  drink out of it, the hotter it is the faster it gets the job 
done.  If they complain about getting a loose bowel from it just cut it back, cut it back to either 
three ounces and three, or two and two, and if it still works as too much of a laxative cut th e prune 
juice out altogether and just have them drink the hot water.

Alkaline Tendencies Digestion.  The higher the pH the slower the digestion or the tearing apart and the proteins 
are digesting slowly. 
 
UpH - 6.4 
 
 
Acid Tendencies 
 
Bones.  The lower the UpH the more the bones begin to hurt and quite often young people, who are growing so 
rapidly, will complain about their bones actually hurting, the joints actually hurting.  Check them out you'll find that 
most of them are into an acid situation. 
 
Bowel Problems.  The more acid the system becomes the more you can look for digestive problems:  
 Putrefaction.  The lower the UpH the greater the putrefaction in the bowel and the body is reabsorbing all 
types of toxins and that in turn effects the liver. 
 Ionization.  The lower the UpH the more abnormal or irregular the ionization taking place, especially in the 
bowel area and such things as ulcers, colitis, spastic colon will show up. 
 
Digestion.  The lower the UpH, the more acid the system and the more rapid the digestion, there's a rapid tearing 
apart: 
 there is an extreme, rapid digestion of protein and in the rapid digestion of protein you have the rapid release 
of heat, and with the rapid rele ase of heat and the breaking down of the foods the body will try and move this 
material out in a hurry and the result will be diarrhoea.  There will be a loss of energy also, but the symptom 
will be diarrhoea, or loose bowel. 
 
Dolomite & Low pH.  Be careful in giving dolomite when you have a low pH because the acid in the body will take 
the magnesium oxide and turn it to a magnesium sulphate and then you've got a problem.  This applies for most 
people but the effect is exaggerated in pregnancy.  So the dolomite effect is simplest when the pH is over 6.40 but be 
aware that the more acid a person is the less likely you are to give them dolomite.  
 
Fat.  An acid body tends to store fat in the form of increasing sized buttocks, thighs and abdomen.  
 
Female Problems, women who are acid tend to have all types of problems that generally start in the reproductive 
system: 
 their monthly cycles will be irregular, 
 they'll have very difficult monthly cycles, 
 they'll have hot flashes, 
 young women in their early teens, 14, 15 , 16 who have entered puberty and have exited puberty into 
menopause because of an extremely low calcium, as reflected in the pH numbers.  
 
Many times young couples want to have a baby but the pregnancy can't start, it won't take place because there's too 
much calciums in the system (high pH), it's got to get down right before the pregnancy can take place.  Many times 
two or three tablespoonfuls of vinegar a day on extremely alkaline systems will bring about a pregnancy in childless 
couples.  Two or three tablespoonfuls of Heinz Sweet Pickle Vinegar, do not use the straight vinegar because it's too 
strong.  If you must use a straight vinegar use only about one fourth the amount that I have just recommended.  But I 
was speaking about the Heinz Sweet Pickle Vin egar it will generally bring about a pregnancy.  Also whenever the 
body's too acid, a pregnant woman doesn't put on weight because the food is digesting too quickly.  
 
Heart Pressure.  The lower the UpH the more work the heart is called upon to do and the g reater the pressure on 
the heart. 
 
Muscles.  The lower the UpH the more the muscles will tend to be sore and the person tends to ache all over.  
 
Varicosing of veins takes place in a very acid system 
 
Vitamin C Problems: 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================
PAGE 44

 The lower the urine pH the greater the deficiency of vitamin C and the more acid a person becomes, say 
around 6.00, vitamin C basically becomes not available to the system, and a lot of people who are sick at that 
point think, "oh, if I could only have more vitamin C" so they start piling i t in even more.  Depending on 
what they're taking it could only compound their problem and make an acid situation more acid still.  
 The other area that hurts so much on a vitamin C deficiency is the colon itself loses its tone of muscle and it 
tends to have  a dropping or a prolapse, and this also shows quite often in the protruding abdomens that you 
see walking around our country. 
 When the pH is running extremely acid that in turn effects the vitamin C and it's just a constant cycle and our 
challenge is to get in there and break the cycle. 
 A severe and progressing vitamin C deficiency state used to be called scurvy, and is now called collagen 
disease. 
 With a low UpH you need to work on them and this is where if you can teach the people to eat their vitamin 
C in the form of onion soup so much the better. 
 The more acid the UpH the lower the vitamin C and the easier they bruise.  The capillaries break and bruising 
takes place, without even any bump.  In fact, again using a husband wife situation, if the husband e ven so 
much as helps his wife out of the car, later that day she can show an arm and here is the whole hand print 
right there.  The body chemistry is reflecting what it does. 
 Those of you who are chiropractors and you work on your clients and they're back to you in two or three days 
because the adjustment didn't hold.  Chances are they're a very acid person.  You as a Reams tester will tell 
someone to go get an adjustment, they'll go get the adjustment and in a couple of hours, couple of days it's 
gone.  An  acid body does not have the ability to hold a chiropractic adjustment.  The muscles, the tendons, 
the ligaments do not have the tone, do not have the vitamin C to hold them in proper place.  
 
You must remember sometimes whatever you refer to people and wha t you want them to do, if you tell them to take 
500 units of C: 
 they'll go home and do what you say, they'll take 500 for you, 
 and then they add 500 for what Grandma says to do, 
 and 500 for Aunt Matilda, and 
 
pretty soon you have a person who is doing your  program and they can answer truthfully if you ask them, "are you 
doing the program?" 
"Oh yes", 
but if you don't ask them, "are you doing anything more, are you taking anything extra?" they don't even bother 
answering that and you'll never know it.  So sharpen up your pencil with questions when you do speak with them.

pH & Calciums .  So the calciums that are needed to maintain our perfect health in life goes back to the 
responsibility of the farmer, and he hasn't been taught anything but to put lime on the ground, because there's no 
money in lime, it's only about 8 dollars a ton delivered, and many times they'll apply it on your farm for that much.  
Now the experiment station says that if you have a pH of 7 you don't need lime, well, white sand itself has a pH of 7, 
pure distilled water has a pH of 7 and they don't have any calcium in it. 
 
Now pH is a measure of resistance and it is the resistance in our body that it gives us energy that brings this about 
and the various forms of energy are like the parts of a jig saw puzzle that are put to gether to form the micronage or 
molecule and they are in such great proportions until you can't express them in numbers.  
 
Double Acid, Diarrhoea .  Now suppose that the food that we eat was acid, the saliva was acid, the pH of the 
hydrochloric acid was too low, (the HCl is still a base but you can take comfort in the fact that it's actually on the 
borderline between and acid and a base), and the food can't digest, then what happens?  What would happen in your 
system if you had a double acid? 
 
Not much ! 
 
In other words, there wouldn't be a whole lot happening there at all because the food wouldn't be digesting, it would 
just be laying in the stomach and consequently you'd get diarrhoea, that would be the result.  
 
Why diarrhoea? 
Because you have created a favo urable environment for your anaerobic bacteria, or for a fungus to get in there and 
it's the fungus or bacteria which actually would bring about the diarrhoea.  You better believe they'll have diarrhoea 
if it stays low enough long enough because the food i s not digesting and nature would be throwing it out.  Now with 
a very low pH it's too acidy in there, the electrons are moving too rapidly and the energy that's given off cannot be 
absorbed, and therefore diarrhoea sets in.  Nature's trying to fix that und esirable choice of food in there and it bursts 
out and you have diarrhoea. 
 
Remedies and Solutions

Acid System.  For a highly acid system you can also get the calcium oxide in saline solutions 5  cc, which does a 
marvellous job for neurosis, nervousness, climbing a wall and so forth. 
 
Acidophilus.  Acidophilus culture is a lactate, and is only recommend when the urine pH is over 6.40.  
 
Apple Cider Vinegar.  Apple cider vinegar can be used for the control of alkalinity but you have to dilute it about 5 
times, but there's also a variable in that.  The little bit of sweetening that's in the Heinz Sweet Pickle vinegar makes 
it much more palatable, and not only that, it seems to ionize into a realm that is more acceptable than the straight 
vinegar. 
 
Dilute Gastric Juice.  There's two causes for a dilute liver bile, 
 Lack of calcium in the liver is the major cause, and 
 Lack of oxygen for the liver is the minor cause. 
 
You can have numbers that are almost perfect looking, they seem to be only a little bit out y et the liver is in very bad 
shape and the liver bile is very dilute. 
  
Male,  42,  5'  11",  180 lb. 
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.40 saliva_ph=6.80 conductivity=10 cell_debris=4 nitrate_nitrogen=2 ammonia_nitrogen=8
 
The very fact that those ureas numbers were way out (2 over 8) means that the liver bile is very dilute.  
 
Alcohol is the greate st enemy that calciums ever had and some people's own system can manufacture too much 
alcohol.  Excessive alcohol in the system oxidises the calcium in the liver which means a lack of calcium for the 
liver which causes the gastric juice to be too dilute.   
 
A deficiency of oxygen can occur if there are lung problems, like mucous on the lungs, asthma, emphysema, cystic 
fibrosis, and so forth, even smog and pollution can affect the oxygen availability to the liver also causing the gastric 
juice to be too dilute.  A loss of reserve energy also means that the gastric juice is becoming dilute, there is a lack of 
mineral content in our diet or a lack of mineral available to our system. 
 
If you're healthy you should mix acid with alkaline in your diet, but if you're sick then you better go easy.  The more 
dilute the gastric juice the more careful you have to be with your diet. 
 
PART 4 
 
SALT 
 
 
Salt.  See Also "Conduct - Salinity", "Insulin", "Pancreas - Insulin", Ureas".  Salt performs many and varied vital 
functions in the body, like the destruction of worms and parasites, purification of cellular waste, conduction of 
electricity, ionization, and so forth. 
 
The "perfect" salt reading is between 600 and 700 micromhos (or microsiemens) per centimetre as measured b y the 
dilute method, and that is abbreviated to 6 to 7 C (C being the Roman letter for 100).  Remember 6 - 7 C is perfect 
when, and only when, ALL numbers are perfect. 
 
The saline reading is derived from at least 48 different varieties of salts within two main groups in the body.  The 
two main groups being: 
 Chloride Salts.  Like calcium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, etc.., and  
 Non-Chloride Salts.  Like insulin, ureas, nitrate nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, etc..

There are many different ki nds of the chloride salts, in fact most of the salts are chloride, and when you get a salt 
substitute it simply means that the salt is not the sodium chloride table salt, it is a chloride salt but it's not sodium 
chloride. 
 
The effects of the salts are AGE  related, and generally the higher the salt reading and the longer the time the more 
damage is being done and the greater the stress on the heart and body.  Remember the further away from perfect a 
number is the lower the energy.  The increasing salt readings are: 
 0-6 The body is lacking electrolytes and therefore there is dullness, absentmindedness and 
forgetfulness because the nerve message is not going through. 
 6-7 Perfect (When ALL numbers are Perfect). 
 7-12 As it starts to move above 7 towards 12 things are starting to go wrong.  This is the first indication 
that the blood vessels and even the intestines are losing a little bit of their flexibility or elasticity.  
 12-18 From 12 up is usually the beginning of the cholesterol connection but it's reall y noticeable about 
18.  Also from 12 you begin to lose tone and elasticity in the intestines, veins and arteries.  Instead 
of them having an elasticity to them they begin to harden and become solid tubes through which 
the heart has to pump the blood.  You' re setting the stage at whatever age for arterial sclerosis later 
on.  Remember, the higher the salt the more rapidly the blood vessels and intestines lose their 
elasticity and the more cholesterol forms on the inner walls. 
 18-35 At 20 you duplicate some o f the same symptoms from an acid situation, like bruising for no 
apparent reason, and the heart is having to work harder because as the salt goes up the blood gets 
thicker and it doesn't have as much oxygen as it should.  At 30 you're beginning to have the  chest 
discomfort and cholesterol is forming rapidly in proportion to 35. 
 35-48 Generally, when the salts have been high for a while they experience dryness of the mouth from 35 
and at 40 angina pains start showing.  The danger zone for cholesterol is from about 45 to 48. 
 48-80 At 50 you're looking at a person that's almost dead.  This is the fatal heart attack zone for 
cholesterol to turn loose. 
 
Because the numbers move in circles, it means that there can also be a lowering salt level.  For instance, when  all 
numbers are away from perfect the salt level also should be away from perfect; if it is moving towards perfect then 
there is a problem.  When all numbers are away from perfect, AND the salt is lowering, AND the person has NOT 
been drinking the water to reduce it, a reading a showing the numbers below indicates a problem: 
 20 At a reducing 20 there is a tumor developing, 
 16 At 16 it's starting to grow, 
 13 At 13 it's growing more rapidly, i.e. becoming more malignant, 
 6-7 At 6 to 7 there is an advanced tumor. 
 
Those are the levels of increasing and decreasing salt, and remember, the further away from perfect the greater the 
loss of energy, and now you can understand that cholesterol forming in the blood vessels is actually a loss of energy.  
With all the test cards that Doc read in his 50 years of work the highest salt he saw was about 72, and that's very 
rare.  The man was nearly dead. 
 
In addition to blood salts there are: 
 Muscular salts, 
 Intestinal salts, and 
 Vascular Salts 
 
which causes the muscles, in testines and blood vessels to lose their tone and elasticity, i.e., their power to expand 
and contract.  For instance salt stored in the intestines causes: 
 diverticulitis, 
 sagging intestines, 
 pockets in the intestines, and 
 all kinds of odd things which mig ht even be called "cartoon intestinals".  In other words the intestines 
actually look more like cartoons than they do an intestinal tract. 
 
Vascular, or blood vessel salts cause similar things in the blood vessels as happens in the intestinal tract as can be 
seen on the legs of people with varicose veins.

Now your blood salts may be normal but the other three may be high, so in adults your blood salt is not an indication 
of how much salt is stored in the muscle, or how much is stored in the blood vessels o r the intestines. 
 
Now the higher the saline reading the more cautious you should be in lowering it.  If the reading is above 47 to be 
exact, you must put them in a retreat.  Please don't try to handle that kind of a case or you may have a corpse on your 
hand.  Get them to a retreat where it can be handled quickly and wisely.  
 
Now the more you work with the numbers the more you're going to see people with a high salt level and one 
comment many will make to you is, "I don't eat salt, I just don't have any sa lt at all."  You can tell them it's the "total 
combined salts" reading, and they get their salts: 
 indirectly from their food, and 
 they're being processed and flushed from within their system and don't necessarily come from the salt shaker.  
 
Chemically on salts you're talking anything that's an electrolyte, chloride or non chloride, and this is what you've got 
in your system and it can be from Day 1.  Now high salts in children MAY be from growth factors, such as nitrogen 
salts, but when Doc often saw high salts in young children his answer often was: 
 pretzels, 
 corn chips, 
 crackers, 
 popcorn, or 
 some other salty snack food. 
 
so it's a matter of finding where the salt is coming from.  We should not be too upset with a salt of 52 on a child of 1 
year because ba bies and young children tend to have a higher salt because of the child's growth factors, but 
sometimes a high salt, say 52, we can then assume that the child is either being fed crackers by grandma, or they're 
eating something that is salty.  Even if that 's not the case we find that for such a little body it registers a high reading 
and it takes a goodly number of tests over a period of time to see this come down even into the 20 range which, 
while still high, compared to where they were the body is making  progress.  Now even though the salt range may 
look horrendous, and it is, a baby's body chemistry will change so quickly that in a week this will not be the same 
body chemistry.  It will change that dramatically. 
 
We recommend additional "salt" according to the numbers.  If your saline test numbers are over 7 you do not add 
salt to your diet.  If you have a salt -free diet then it means NO salt, and that includes all salts, not just sodium 
chloride, but all salts.  So many people think that they can eat "No  Salt", or "Saltless Salt, or "Sea Salt" or "Celtic 
Salt" or some other substitute but just say, "no more salt" 
"can I have sea salt?" 
"No, you can't have sea salt.  Actually sea salt contains 7 different kinds of salt, and three in organic forms and it's 
the worst of all salts to take because if one of them doesn't get you the other six will."  Any chloride salt that is not 
sodium chloride is called a salt substitute, even potassium chloride.  But they are still "salts" and will affect the body 
chemistry and the salts number.  Even foods like kelp or dulse are generally high in salt but you may be able to get 
salt-free dulse.  Remember, salt is salt is salt, period. 
 
Salt is an electrolyte in the system and is necessary for the ionization process, but keep in mind the general effects of 
excessive salt in the system: 
 It hardens the blood vessels.  They lose their elasticity and their ability to expand and contract and over time 
they can even become brittle and break. 
 It causes cholesterol to form in the arter ies and veins and stresses the heart.  The higher the total salt reading 
the more cholesterol there is being plated onto the walls of the arteries and veins, but not necessarily in the 
blood.  In other words, the blood may show a perfect cholesterol yet th ere can be a very high amount of 
cholesterol on the arteries and veins, in fact there may even be phlebitis, yet the blood can show a normal 
blood cholesterol.  Autopsies have confirmed normal blood cholesterol yet the arteries and veins are clogged 
with it. 
 It overcharges the nervous system and causes it to fray leading to a breaking down of the nerves.  
 High salt and a lack of calcium is one of the great causes of ulcers.  If you want ulcers just let your calciums 
go down and use excessive salt and you have set the stage for it.

There's two ways for salt to get out of the system in great amounts: 
 Perspiration, and 
 Urination. 
 
and women generally have an extra one that most men don't have, the tears.  It is said, "the oceans are made out of a 
woman's tears". 
 
With the liver's function shown by the saliva reading of 6.40, any reading away from perfect means a dilution of the 
liver bile and the more dilute the gastric juice, the weaker it gets.  The weaker the hydrochloric acid in the stomach 
then the liver is unable to split the salts that come in, unable to ionize them, and therefore they accumulate because 
there is generally insufficient water to wash them out.  Remember this, if your liver is functioning properly you're 
going to be getting rid of the salts, if it's not functioning properly you're going to be storing salts, so the salt reading 
can also reflect how your liver is working. 
 
You do not need to be deeply concerned about the salts until they get up to around 12 to 18 then you notice that 
cholesterol is beginning to form in the system.  Also there's a ratio between your chloride salts (conductivity meter) 
and your non chloride salts (urea salts).  Both are salts.  The conductivity meter reads your total salts whereas the 
urea salts are only you r nitrogenic salts which do not contain chlorine, so you must keep in mind what each thing 
does.  Also there is a ratio between your salt and your urea such that the higher the salt number goes the lower the 
urea can be for a pectoris heart attack.  In other words, you can have a fatal heart attack with a urea of 24 if you have 
a salt of 47 C or above, and you can even have two kinds of a heart attack at the same time.  
 
Delta cells (or waste cells) do not go out through the skin, if they did people would be  able to smell us a half mile 
off.  Waste cells are thrown out of the tissues in cellular form into the blood stream and so the waste goes out 
through the urine with a high amount of salt.  Incidentally, it's the salt in the ocean that purifies this planet  and keeps 
it habitable.  If it wasn't for the salt in the oceans this planet would become so filthy we couldn't live upon it and in a 
similar manner it's the salts thrown out into the urine that also keeps the urine from smelling like the stool.  Now if 
the waste cells from the tissues stay in the blood stream for more than three days they break down into a urea salt 
and when that happens they cause the heart to beat too hard.  If you drink enough water it will wash those cells out 
in cellular form, they will not break down into a salt and the heart will beat soft. 
 
That now brings us to the point about the first test.  The numbers in the first reading that you ever do on anyone will 
not mean the same if you found those exact same numbers 6 months later on the same person that had been on a diet 
because the timing would be different, the age would be different, they've grown a little older.  It makes a difference.  
 
You will notice that when you test people regularly, that one time they come in with an 18C, t he next time they 
might have a 4C if they're on a fast or something, the next time they'll jump back up to a 12C then back down again 
then back up again.  When you make your diet sheet notice the first test, if it was say an 18C originally and the next 
time it comes down to a 4C or something and the next time it jumps back up to a 12C.  Just because it jumps down 
to a 4C one time you do not want to tell them to add salt to their diet because the 18C has not had time to come 
down and adjust itself, you want to wait until that 18C has come down and the bobbing back and forth has limited 
itself down before you put salt back in their diet. 
 
When the liver is working properly it splits the salts, takes the chlorine and uses it as a germicide, as a cleanser in 
the body and it's the chlorine that keeps our bugs under control, our worms under control, it keeps us from having 
too many parasites and keeps the bacteria at bay.  Even though we think we don't, we sweat, a little bit of oil comes 
out of our skin and there' s a little salt and sodium in that, and that also keeps us from being attacked by many 
different kinds of bacteria, or many different kinds of fungus.  Viruses should not be in the blood, but some bacteria, 
like aerobic bacteria and the ones you find in yo ghurt are normal and indeed a number of bacterial families should 
be in the blood, even a minor amount of some of the salmonellas should be in there in order to ward off the other 
salmonellas.   Now the "Salmonella" group is a large group and Malaria is a salmonella, and if you get over it a little 
of it stays in the blood.  Funguses should not be in the blood because the salt would break down any fungus, but it 
would not break down certain bacteria.  Funguses are plants that require CO2 gas and bacteria requires oxygen.

There are some people who eat no salt, no NaCl, yet have a high salt reading, yet their partner is pouring it all over 
their food, even before they taste it, and their salt number is relatively low.  This occurs because one person is 
dumping it out of their system and the other person isn't.  For instance, if the wife adds no salt to her meals and has a 
salt reading of 48C and her husband is a salt maniac and his test is 10C or maybe even a 26C the wife's body is 
releasing it while her husband's body is storing it.  Now the exact interpretation depends on the other numbers but if 
you liver is working properly the salt will come out and if the liver is not working properly it will store the salt.  If 
the salt is stored in t he body then it'll be stored according to the line of least resistance, and as it hardens the arteries 
and veins and causes cholesterol to be deposited that will happen all over the body, even in the brain and cause 
hardening and crystallization of the arteries there too. 
 
You cannot make a case on one number alone, if the salt reading is really low you have to see what the others are 
doing.  The cause may be that the body is storing salt rather than dumping it because all you're testing is what the 
body is dumping, so look at all the numbers, see the picture.  You could have a low salt and be storing it and you can 
have a high salt and be storing it also.  But you could also have a low salt and be dumping it too because you're 
flushing it out.  So you have to look at all the numbers and see what they're saying. 
 
When you have a person with a dangerously high salt, or a dangerously high urea, before they do anything else they 
should take distilled water until: 
 the urea level is below 20, and 
 the salt level is  reasonably lower.  Sometimes the salt lowers quickly and sometimes it's as stubborn as a 
balking mule - it'll hardly budge for about a week and then it starts to move down.  That may be because 
nature may be preventing a rapid contraction of the veins so that it gives the cholesterol time to get out. 
 
Suppose that you have a patient and you're checking them every day for a while and all the numbers are in Range 1, 
all except the salt which went way up to 60 and you say, "I told you not to eat any salt.  Wh at did you do, empty the 
salt shaker on your food?" 
"no I haven't used any salt at all, not one grain." 
 
Now they told you the truth, they haven't used any extra salt.  They were about as salted down as a piece of salt 
bacon and the body released the salt and for a day or two it was way up high then it dropped back down. 
 
The salt level does not refer to an intake of energy, it's really a reflection that there's a change in body chemistry 
taking place.  Remember, too much salt hardens the arteries and then cholesterol forms in there and when 
cholesterol forms you are losing energy and remember too, the further from perfect the greater the loss of energy.  
For instance, suppose your salt was between 6 and 7, perfectly normal, you can empty the salt shaker on your food 
and it stayed between 6 and 7 all the time, but your urea was 29.  Now the urea is also a salt.  Now this situation is 
possible because the salts that are within the blood are turning the delta cells to a salt in the blood and while there's 
not enough salt in the urine to measure, there's enough to overstimulate the heart all the time.  Now the cholesterol 
would be normal but this situation would bring forth pain in the left arm, and a constricture there of the muscles, and 
be a pectoris heart attack. 
 
Burning urine when you urinate is caused partially by the salts in the system, in fact there are two causes:  
 A very acid urine will burn, irritate and tenderise the lining of the urethra, then  
 it is the salt, either urea salt or chloride salt, extrac ted from the system by the kidneys that actually causes the 
burning. 
 
So the acid damages the lining of the urethra and the salt causes it to sting.  It's like putting salt in a cut that causes 
the burning.  As Doc used to say, "the finest thing I know for  burning in the urethra is a little bi -carb of soda, a level 
teaspoonful in water a couple of times, and generally in 24 to 30 hours it will knock it unless there is serious 
deterioration and breaking down of the cell structure, even to the point of being really a cancer, and not carcinoma, 
and therefore throwing into the system a form of dilute post mortea and so keeping the body way too acid all the 
time. 
 
Keeping in mind the relationship between salt and cholesterol, the cause of glaucoma is a mineral de ficiency and the 
body retaining too much salt and the glaucoma is a cholesterol that forms in the eye.

Now keep this in mind, we need to get the salts out of our system, we cannot afford to let them build up or the 
effects will even go up into the arterie s and veins in the brain because the irritation and ionization caused by the salt 
will cause the liver to manufacture cholesterol there.  Salt is an irritant, it stings, it burns, and the liver manufactures 
this smooth, glistening, coating of cholesterol t o relieve the irritation and there's no relationship at all to cholesterol 
coming in through your mouth and what comes out in your arteries and veins.  
 
Now, when the blood salt level starts to increase, it's like pickling a piece of meat on the inside and not only is the 
body affected but the brain as well, in addition: 
 There is a thickening of the blood, 
 There is increased irritation of the inner walls of the blood vessels,  
 There is an increase in ionization on the blood vessel walls, the plating effects increase which causes 
cholesterol to be plated. 
 There is a loss of elasticity, 
 There is a loss of muscle tone, 
 Weakening of the smooth muscle, and 
 There is the beginning of hardening of the arteries. 
 
When the salts were high then reduced by a proper program and the people still have thicker blood in the legs, or 
hypertension, or high blood pressure, then the recommendation is walking, walking, walking because it's the 
pumping and kneading action of the muscle s on the vessels in the legs that starts moving this thicker blood, to begin 
getting it going back up to where it needs to go.  In other words, the blood moves in the veins by muscle action and 
walking is about the best exercise there is. 
 
The blood actual ly moves through the arteries by the muscular pumping action of the blood vessel itself, pulsation 
it's called, where the artery is pulsating (arteries have a muscular wall and veins don't, veins have valves) and that's 
why when you put your fingers on you r wrist you feel that little thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk.  That's the artery that's 
pulsating.  (If the artery cannot assist in the movement of blood throughout the body because of hardening and loss 
of elasticity in the vessel walls, and the blood is also thicker, then the burden of moving this thickened blood falls 
back onto the heart, causing heart stress.  
 
The blood moves back through the veins because of muscle action, and the valves in the veins keep the blood from 
moving backwards.  Now with all this  happening remember that the blood vessel going to the brain, the carotid 
artery, is really a vein because it does not have muscular walls and contains valves in it.  Arteries move blood 
primarily by the pulsation of the muscles in their walls, and since t he carotid artery is a vein it has no muscle in the 
walls and no inherent pulsation.  The pulse in the carotid artery actually comes from its proximity to the heart, it's 
the reverberation, or the vibration, from the beating of the heart. 
 
Now when the sal t level is high enough long enough the veins get twisted out of shape and partially blocked by 
cholesterol and are called varicose veins.  Here the blood does not move through as rapidly as it should and the 
action of the muscles can start to move that thi cker blood along.  Now when pockets of stagnant blood form within 
these varicosities then you have phlebitis.  Now the blood is moving through the varicosities but it's not moving as 
well as it should. 
 
Now the purpose of vitamin E is to thin the blood.  T he muscles do not thin the blood, the vitamin E does, but the 
muscles get it moving.  See in addition to the vitamin E you need to tell them to walk, walk, walk and start drinking 
water and that should take care of the condition. 
 
You bring the ureas and s alts down the same way for everybody, both vegetarian or non -vegetarian alike, by using 
dolomite and lemonade and water.  There is no difference in the treatment of vegetarians or non -vegetarian. 
 
A special note needs to be made for people who are diabetic s on insulin.  Medical insulin is a salt, and it does all the 
things that a salt does.  We do not take people off of insulin and we do NOT put people who are on insulin on a fast.  
If there are people who want to get off of insulin then only in the retreat do we give them a diet to cause the pancreas 
to behave and to manufacture the right amount of insulin,  but remember, salt is age related and over the years of 
their taking insulin their systems have stored it up like salt pork.  It's hardened their arter ies and if they've been on it 
long enough it's crystallised the arteries and veins in their brain and in their kidneys and in their joints and they're

52 
really in trouble, and when their body starts to release this stored insulin then many times they begin v omiting and 
start to dehydrate and in the mean time insulin is still pouring into their system, released from their body actions, 
and then their platelets begin to drop because the insulin salt is too high in their blood and then you've got to get 
them in a hospital where they can have IV solutions in order to tone this down so it can pass out through the 
kidneys. 
 
Now they're LUCKY if this is what happens, but if they've been on insulin long enough and those arteries and veins 
are crystallised to the point of breaking, and if they break in the brain they'll go into a coma and you've lost a patient.  
Or if it's not quite that far advanced they may be breaking in the kidneys, and cause the kidneys to break down and 
they start passing blood.  If they're not th at far advanced then they may start breaking down in the joints causing 
excruciating pain in the joint.  So when you get a person off of insulin you've really got a problem on your hands.  
For more detail read the part on "insulin" under the section on the pancreas. 
 
Once you learn to eat food without salt you won't even miss it, and if the cook knows how to season foods and use 
the condiments properly you'll never miss the salt.  The proper use of your condiments, your all -spice, a little bit of 
honey, a little bit of blackstrap molasses will give the flavor of salt when there's no salt in it. 
 
PART 5 
 
 
ALBUMIN or DEBRIS 
 
(The information presented here has been updated by more recent teachings and the readings range is different.)  
 
Albumin.  Albumin is another name for the cellular waste, or debris, in the urine and even includes delta and omega 
cells (carcinoma and cancer cells).  The perfect albumin number is .04 M ("M" is short for Million), or 40, 000 parts 
per quart (1200 ml) when ALL numbers are perfect.   
 
Albumin arises from a natural, cellular, base exchange, new cells for old, and is the waste cells that are thrown out.  
For instance, a carcinoma cell is a cell that is being exchanged, it's the base exchange cell before it reaches the stage 
of cancer or decayed cell.  For instance, a perfectly healthy baby chick couldn't grow unless it changed every cell in 
its body every two days.  Now these exchange cells are carcinoma cells and in people, if carcinoma cells stay in long 
enough they may, MAY, turn to cancer.  In other words they may lose so much energy until they are a decayed cell. 
 
When you're healthy and drinking the correct amount of water then an adult should throw out 40 000 millilitres, or 
.04 M, of dead cells with each quart of urine, and if you throw out more than that something is seriously wrong.  
Many times the albumin reading is higher than 4 M, and I've seen it like soup, but above 4 M it's all counted the 
same, we just quit counting at 4 M.  Now the higher the albumin reading the greater dilation  of the blood vessels in 
the eyes so you see there's a link between the albumin reading with that in the eye.  
 
The albumin at 4M shows that there's a disturbance taking place in the body, and the body is relieving the 
disturbance.  Now when the body is reb uilding there's a lot of base exchange occurring, new cells for old, and the 
delta and omega cells can be thrown out with such extreme rapidity that they can look like pus in the urine, because 
they are still compacted, still together. 
 
In the cell, nitrog en is stored in the cell membrane and the cell protoplasm and when you take the albumin reading 
you are actually analyzing cellular debris, dead cells, which in fact is nitrogen that's still bound up in there.  If your 
system retains the protoplasmic parts  of these dead cells for three days they'll start breaking down into ammonia 
salts, which then build up the toxicity and increase the salt content.  Now a high salt content does many things 
including weakens the smooth muscles and increases the plating effects. 
 
In the equation, 1.5  6.40 over 6.40, denotes an energy increase and the purpose in bringing it towards perfect is to 
have a result in the 3 over 3 part, the ureas, and that's cause and effect.  Now when you start a program the albumin 
particles are big at first and then they get smaller and smaller and smaller until they look like little diamonds drifting 
in there when the light shines on them, and you can see those with no problem, but if ever the urea gets up to 20 and 
you can't see those little p articles bouncing in there you're in trouble, I've never seen it happen but I've lived in fear

============================================================

 
 
53 
to a certain extent that it could happen.  But the person would be so tired and the wrinkles would be back in the 
forehead and it'll be visible.  When you get it  as thick as soup you know it's too high to count, it's out of proportion 
and after 4 million it doesn't make any difference, nature is cooperating and it's all you want to know.  
 
Now if the total ureas are at 7 - 13 it shows that nature is practically not cooperating at all, maybe just a little at 12 or 
13, but so very slightly it's barely noticeable, really just enough to be encouraging to continue, that nature is barely 
starting to relieve the disturbance by throwing out the delta cells as cellular waste .  A urea reading from 13 - 24 or 
25 is normal but if it gets to 27 or 28 they should begin to drink water like it's going out of style.  Now as far as the 
heart is concerned the quick release and disposal of cellular waste is harmless because the waste (d elta) cells have 
not broken down to a salt, and in those cases it wouldn't hurt if the urea gets up to 26 or 28 or 29 for three or four 
days, however it's not desirable, but you will sometimes see this happen if you watch enough numbers.  
 
With a heavy conc entration of waste cells just drink your regular amount of water and it'll drop them down.  The 
exchange cells are just flowing out real fast and if the urea goes up then it's just temporary thing and generally have 
them to drink a little bit more water th an normal, but it's nothing serious.  Go by your stethoscope, use that 
stethoscope. 
 
Now during rebuilding the ureas should go up into the 20's because they're also a measure of the delta and the 
omega cells that are thrown out of the body through the urin ary tract.  Now if these cells came out through our skin, 
like the salt does, you would smell us for half a mile, but God made it a different way of getting them out.  
 
The herb Golden Seal is a blood purifier, not a blood thinner in the sense of Vitamin E,  it's a blood purifier and it 
works by dilating the capillaries in the kidneys, letting large particles of albumin, delta and omega cells get out into 
the urinary tract. 
 
The body replaces cells by throwing them into the blood where they're carried to the kidneys and filtered out into the 
urine and everybody should have waste particles in the urine.  Put the specimen in a clear plastic or glass cup or 
beaker and hold it up to the light and look in it, counting any particles you see.  However, when you look in the 
specimen it is better to use a penlight because then the particles will shine like little diamonds.  Count the particles 
and multiply them by 20 000 because for each particle you see, even though it looks like a tiny diamond, it's really a 
boulder compared to the approximate 20 000 particles of energy you can't see.  Also, after you get to 4 million just 
quit counting because it doesn't make any difference.

Whenever you see 1 or 2 particles in there with your eye you've got a pretty good one.  This table is not worked out 
on volume, it's a table  like πr2 (no - pies are round).  The volume of sample doesn't matter because the debris has 
been already mixed up in the bladder and it's constant.  With the debris itself we're dealing in millions, but the main 
thing you want to know is, "is nature cooperating or isn't it cooperating", and this is actually what this reading lets us 
know, and that's very unimportant when you are writing a diet because these are cells cast off in the change process 
and are not a result of rebuilding, for instance: 
 Some people are dying with cancer and their debris reading is almost perfect, because the cancer was not 
breaking up and getting into the blood stream, and all we want to know is, "if it gets in the blood stream is 
it getting into the kidneys?"

 There have been a fe w cases of cancer of the kidneys in which the small specimen we were able to get 
was almost totally clear because we couldn't get any water through the kidneys.  In those cases the patient 
died within 3 days because their kidneys were unable to function, b ut the little drop they did manage was 
almost absolutely clear, and it's actually a miracle how they got any specimen at all.  
 In some the specimen looked like pure blood coming out of the kidneys because there was such breaking 
down of the cancer. 
 In others the specimen looked like very thick soup. 
 I've seen others with very thick sedimentation in the bottom of the container because that was actually 
pieces of cancer cells coming out and thrown out through the kidneys, or are pieces of the kidney.  
 
You can tell a cancer kidney cell from the other regular cancer cells by the colour.  In the specimen the kidney 
cancer cell is the light one and the regular body cancer cell is the most red, or the darker red, or deeper red, or deeper 
colour, and sometimes it can  be both which will give it a blend between a red and a greenish battleship grey, 
between a battleship grey and a green colour.  
 
Someone who has a 4M reading and goes on the program, and if they void a reddish urine within 3 days then this:  
 may be a typical housecleaning situation, or 
 sometimes it could be a kidney stone that turned loose and the irritations breaking up, or  
 it could be ulcers in the bladder, or urethra, or 
 it could be in the prostate gland of a man, or 
 it could be during a woman's men strual period (it doesn't make any difference whether the woman is 
menstruating or not, you can still do a reading just as well, just don't pay any attention to the red.)  
 
Chaparral capsules are used and if they want they can have chaparral tea extra, but chaparral helps the body to 
exchange cells more rapidly by getting rid of them.  On some people chaparral acts as a laxative and on some it does 
not.  If it does have them cut it down.  Chaparral is recommended according to how bad their problem is, the mo re 
numbers that show up on the card the longer I give them the chaparral.  If they don't have too many numbers 
showing up on their card and they're in pretty good shape I give it to them for maybe 2 or 3 months, and if they've 
got a whole lot of numbers showing up on their card I usually put them on it from 4 to 6 months. 
 
The measurement of cellular waste, debris or albumin is important, but it's not important enough to raise the price of 
the test US$60.00 to precipitate the cells out, which takes about 2 hours, and then to take those cells and run and find 
the protein and then run the other test then subtract the two, it isn't worth it.  I mean it doesn't mean that much.  
 
Even though the perfect albumin reading is .04 M, be aware that in a perfect pregnanc y with perfect numbers the 
albumin will run about 1M.

PART 6 
 
 
UREAS 
 
NITRATE NITROGEN & AMMONIACAL NITROGEN 
 
 
(The procedure to measure the ureas has been updated.  Presented below is how it was measured.)  
 
Ureas.  See also "Salts" and "Nitrogen".  The ureas we measure in the test are the undigested proteins; and protein 
and nitrogen are the same thing, only multiplied by a factor 6.4.  For instance, if you have a breakfast cereal with:  
 6% nitrogen then the protein value is 38.4% (6% x 6.4), and 
 64% protein then the nitrogen factor is 10 (64% / 6.4 is 10%). 
 
Proteins are both carriers and storers of the mineral energy required by the different parts of the body.  If that were 
not true there would not be any such thi ng as amino acids.  Amino acids store protein and this is why amino acids 
are so valuable to you.  Is your kidney made out of the same substance that your brain is made out of ?  Is your brain 
made out of the same substance that your liver's made out of ?  Not at all, entirely a different substance .  So what we 
learn here is that the body distributes and stores the elements required by the respective part of the body that 
contains the element that is in question. 
 
When ALL numbers are perfect, AND your protei ns get above a total of 6, whether it's 5 + 1 or 4 + 2, or 3 + 3 
(which is perfect), that lets you know that there is a beginning of a loss of energy, and the FIRST real sign that there 
is something amiss in your chemistry is an upset in your proteins.  In respect of body chemistry the ureas are the first 
thing to go away from perfect and, when getting well, the last numbers to come back to perfect.  
 
After the first test the ureas should not drop below 12 for at least 6 or 8 months on an adult, or even a year or year 
and a half.  It sits around 18, 20, 22, 24 after the first test and this indicates the body is using potassium.  
 
Now if there is plenty of calciums, or almost enough calciums, then any loss of energy due to an increase in the total 
protein (ureas) can be caused by emotional causes such as: 
 hate, 
 revenge, 
 worry, or 
 not living the golden rule. 
 
In other words these things can be the beginning of your liver not accepting enough calciums and it can be the 
beginning of ulcers (which again the liver' s not accepting enough calciums).  Now it looks like I've made a 
contradiction in what I've said here but I haven't.  ALL disease is a result of a mineral deficiency and there's no 
exception to that rule, but your mental attitude can be one of the causes o f why the mineral deficiency exists, and 
this will show up at the earliest stage in all of the numbers of a loss of energy.  In other words this is where it starts 
moving down from and the higher it goes the greater the loss of energy, or the more rapid th e loss of energy. 
 
The urea is the very first indication of a loss of energy, that is, when all numbers are perfect except their urea and it's 
very seldom that you'll ever find this kind of a case. 
 
That letter on the dolomite would be one of the best thin gs to look at because Doc has in the bottom two paragraphs 
listed the pressure zones beneath that, and it's not in that section, but when you see a combined urea starting around 
16 and below, in former lectures he's indicated that this can indicate a couple of things: 
 it can be a body in a state of change, 
 it can be a potassium deficiency. 
 
By looking at the entire equation and/or using subsequent tests you'll be able to determine the difference.

In regard to nitrogen don't forget this rule, "magnesium is the greatest enemy nitrogen ever had".  Magnesium 
releases nitrogen and dolomite (magnesium oxide of calcium), is used to reduce the undigested protein level in the 
body because it's not a purgative to most people. 
 
In the analysis expression we measure the nitrogen and the difference between the nitrogen readings is: 
 Nitrate nitrogen is anionic, and 
 Ammoniacal nitrogen is cationic. 
 
The nitrate nitrogen is the most dangerous because it causes the heart to beat harder, tiring it out pushing you, 
building up the inward tension a lot more.  It's anionic and works faster and while the ammoniacal nitrogen causes 
the same thing only it just takes a lot more of it.  It effects the heart too but it doesn't do it as fast and as quick and 
it's not as quite as violent .  Now in the equation nitrate nitrogen is the top number, and ammoniacal nitrogen is the 
bottom number. 
 
Remember, "no number is perfect unless all numbers are perfect" and the perfect numbers for the ureas is 3 over 3, 
when, and only when, ALL numbers ar e perfect.  Now you add the two numbers together, and a total of 6 would be 
perfect.  Remember the higher the numbers go above 6 the greater is the loss of energy:  
 6 - 12 Going up from perfect, this is the range in which the person knows something is wrong , that 
the foods are not digesting like they should, that the proteins are not turning into energy, and 
that the proteins are beginning to accumulate, and while it denotes some increasing problems 
there is nothing to be unduly concerned about.  Now on a fi rst test only, if all numbers are out 
and this is 12 or below it denotes a potassium deficiency and then you really need to pay 
attention to it.  A 13 or 14 could also denote a potassium deficiency, but at 12 with all the 
numbers away from perfect, it defi nitely denotes a potassium deficiency.  The sum of any two 
numbers 12 or below denotes a potassium deficiency on the first test only. 
 12 - 18 Means that there's a loss of energy, and at 18 you really begin to be tired, in the morning, at 
night, all the tim e and there is an increasing irritability, particularly when there is low blood 
sugar too. Cholesterol is beginning to form in the system.  There's a ratio between your 
chloride salts (solubridge salts), and your non chloride salts (urea salts).  Both are salts.  The 
solubridge reads your total salts whereas the urea salts are only your nitrogenic salts which do 
not contain chlorine, so this you must keep in mind what each thing does. 
 18 - 20 You're very tired and irritable all the time. 
 20 - 24 Entering the minor pectoris heart attack zone. 
 24 - 26 The major pectoris heart attack zone, but there's some exceptions too.   It's also possible for 26 
to be in the fatal heart attack zone. 
 27 - 30 Any numbers that are greater than 26 is the fatal heart attack zone. 
 
Your numbers could be almost perfect at times and yet your ureas would be too high from eating too much of the 
canned, preserved and embalmed meats, luncheon meats and so forth and the ureas jump way up high and then you 
become tired, irritable and cranky. 
 
Now let's see what happens when the ureas numbers begin to rise.  If that number's up there what's happening inside 
that makes them so tired?  In Doc's own words: 
 
"When I was in college I learned the why of the ureas and I learned by accident what ca used it. 
 
There was a certain professor in the college who decided he was going to go organic and he bought 
himself two milk goats, and this was in the days when many automobiles had canvas tops.  He had the 
goats tied to the automobile when a thundercloud  come up, it scared the goats and they climbed on top of 
the car and poked the canvas top full of holes, and a new top then cost about $35.00, and that was like 
$500.00 today, or even more. 
 
Also at that time, a mate and I shared a farm to help get our way  through school because work was almost 
impossible for your freshman and sophomores and by the time you got to be a junior you found the 
seniors had graduated and given you their job.  But this professor came out to where we lived and said, 
"Do you want two goats?"

"Sure, why not."  Food was hard to get and we could then have goat milk. 
 
On the farm we also had a garden, and one afternoon we were planting some young plants and putting out 
nitrate of soda.  Now with goats you only tie one goat at a time, and  then the other one won't leave, it'll 
graze all around but won't leave.  You tie one for a couple of hours then tie the other one for a couple of 
hours.  While we were working, the goat that wasn't tied got into the bag of nitrate of soda (which was a 
form of urea), and he ate enough to kill him.  It didn't kill him straight away but in a couple of hours he 
was a dead goat.  So I did an autopsy on him and found out he'd died from a heart attack.  The high ureas 
had caused such a severe heart attack that it ruptured the heart, it tore it to pieces. 
 
After I began to do these tests I thought of the thing that caused the goat to have a heart attack, and then I 
noticed that as the ureas begin to climb the heart begins to beat harder each time.  Harder, not any faster, 
but much harder and you can hear it in a stethoscope.  Whenever I heard doctors say, "you've got a heart 
as strong as a horse", all they were saying was, "you're a candidate for a pectoris heart attack caused by 
the ureas being too high." 
 
Now as t he ureas go down, or the cellular form of the ureas change, then the heart begins to beat softer 
and the people aren't tired anymore.  But when the ureas are high they're just as tired in the morning as 
when they went to bed at night because that heart has been beating too hard all night.  It's simply tired." 
 
In regard to these ureas readings, they're the biggest tattle -tales of all the numbers about heart attack, AND HEART 
ATTACKS CAN BE STOPPED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF ANY TIME THE PEOPLE DEMAND IT.  It's 
absolutely unnecessary for anyone to have a heart attack unless they've just got to have one, they can't wait.  
 
Let's say for instance that we have a first reading of 12 over 14.  If there is no other reading besides that one you 
would see wrinkles in their f orehead caused by nervous tension, and that's cause and effect.  Those wrinkles start 
when the ureas total is 20, and the higher the numbers go and the longer they're there the worse the wrinkles get.  
Wrinkles begin at 20, and also at that stage the perso n is tired in the morning, tired at night, and tired all the time.  
When you see a child that has the 20 reading you can say to the parent, "This child is hard to get out of bed in the 
morning because he's so tired, he can't get going, but once he gets going he's a stick of dynamite." 
 
Now if you want to win a girl from 8 - 25 over to you as a patient, and really make a friend for life, especially girls 
in the age group 10 - 15, tell her "your numbers show that you're so tired all the time until you can't h ang up your 
clothes and you can't keep your room tidy." 
"How could you know?" 
And the mother will say, "you're so right." 
"well the child is so tired she just can't do it."  She does do what she wants to do and that's just being human, but 
when it comes to things like this it just doesn't matter enough, she's just too tired. 
"See mum, I told you I was too tired." 
 
And you've got a friend for life, somebody that really believes in you.  Then you fix their diet and the next time 
they're looking at you with a smile on their face from ear to ear almost. 
"Doctor my room is clean, my room is clean.  How is my numbers? How is my numbers?"  
 
There are some people, especially those that have a weight problem, that you will have some difficulty in keeping 
the urea down low enough because the fat cells are being thrown out so rapidly until they keep the urea quite high, 
but as long as those cells are visible with your eye you have nothing to worry about, but if those cells become 
invisible you better watch that urea, and  if you're in doubt about it use a stethoscope, or if they have large veins or 
arteries especially you can also tell by the pulse on the artery or how much a vein stands up on the back of their 
hand.  When you see veins standing very high on the back of th e hand it means the 7th to 8th vertebra needs 
adjustment, there's pressure on that nerve and it causes the blood vessels in the back of the hand to stand up and be 
prominent. 
 
The purpose of the energy intake numbers, 1.5  6.40 over 6.40, is to have a resu lt in the energy outflow part, the 
ureas 3 over 3, and that is cause and effect.  Now the waste particles, albumin or delta cells are big at first and then 
they get smaller and smaller and smaller until they look like little diamonds when the light shines on them, drifting

in there and you can see those with no problem, but if ever the ureas get up to 20 and you can't see those little 
particles bouncing in there you're in trouble, I've never seen that happen but I've lived in fear to a certain extent that 
it could happen.  But the person would be so tired and the wrinkles would be back in the forehead and it'll be visible.  
 
Digressing slightly, the foam on the ocean is nitrogen and that ocean foam is also cyclic, it comes from the 
atmosphere into the ocean, is built up, released, and goes back through the wind and this is part of the cleansing 
process that the earth has.  Now if you sprout grains there is a foam formed on the grain that sprouts and if you don't 
wash that foam off it sours or ferments, but the  bottom line is it kills the sprout.  That foam on the sprout is nitrogen 
and it's the process of sprouting that causes the seed to release the nitrogen, thereby lowering the protein content 
while still remaining a very nutritious food.  It can be low prot ein and yet have all the other enzyme factors that are 
extremely important. 
 
For men, urine should not foam whenever they urinate into the water.  If it forms too much foam it means a high 
ureas and if it smells of ammonia it also means a high ureas becaus e the ammonia occurs from the urea breakdown 
in the proteins that are thrown off and if you can smell the extremely strong odor of ammonia then it's a very high 
concentration, in fact, you're on the verge of a major heart attack in that condition.  While we're on this aspect of 
urea, many times mothers may say, "my baby's urine smells so strong of ammonia and it's really rough to change the 
diaper".  In that case the diet is too rich in proteins for the baby and if she's nursing the baby then the mother should 
begin taking dolomite as follows: 
 1 x 2 a day, then 
 1 x 3 a day, then 
 2 x 2 day, and then 
 2 x 3 a day 
 
so it won't upset th e baby or give the baby diarrhoea.  Now if this high ammonia remains in the urine you will get 
serious skin chapping on the baby because when that ammonia odor is in the diaper it's then very hard to get the 
soap out when it's washed and this is the same t hing that happens in sewage lines whenever they put certain non 
biodegradable detergents in the sewer system, it forms a film on the sewage system and then it clogs it up or breaks 
it down or tears it up.  The same thing is happening in our system only on a very mild, mild scale. 
 
In the cell nitrogen is stored in the cell membrane and the cell protoplasm.  Now in the analysis when you look 
through the urine with a light you are analyzing cellular debris, dead cells, and the dead cells are in fact nitrogen,  but 
it's bound up in those waste cells.  If your system retained these protoplasmic parts of the dead cells for more than 
three days they would break down into ammonia salts and build up the toxicity and salt content.  
  
Remember the effects of increased salt on the system: 
 Thickening of the blood, 
 Increased irritation of the inner walls of the blood vessels, 
 Increased ionization on the blood vessel walls which causes cholesterol to be plated. 
 Increased heart stress, 
 Loss of blood vessel elasticity, 
 Hardening of the blood vessels, 
 Loss of muscle tone, 
 Weakening of the smooth muscle, and 
 Overcharges the nervous system causing it to fray which leads to a breaking down of the nerves.  
 
but the effects on the smooth muscle are particularly important.  Now the enzyme for the handling of fats and oils 
comes from the thyroid (remember "old fashioned grandma's soap").  As the cellular waste stays in and breaks down 
to a salt it causes the sal t level to increase.  The high salt then effects the smooth muscle in the blood vessel walls 
and causes cholesterol to be deposited on those walls to protect them from the high ionization effects of the salts.  In 
fact the cholesterol is there to do a job. 
 
Now what would happen if your body increased it's thyroid production when: 
 the delta cells are increasing, 
 the salt is increasing, 
 the blood is getting thicker,

 the cholesterol is increasing, and 
 the oxygen is getting lower. 
 
The urea would rise and you' d increase the stress on his heart to the point where he'd die, because what's happening 
is this: 
 With a high thyroid output we start an emulsifying action on the fats, oils and cholesterol.  Now sudden 
high doses of lecithin or other emulsifying agents can do this too. 
 The cholesterol starts coming off the vessel walls and it puts a surge of it into the blood stream, 
thickening the blood still more. 
 
The result may be vascular collapse and sudden death from either a pectoris or angina heart attack, or both  of them 
at the same time.  High ureas is what the medical profession call uremic poisoning and crib death is caused because 
of the high ureas. 
 
It's the undigested proteins that's the prime cause of many, many crib deaths.  Not all of them, but most of th em are 
caused because the ureas are causing that baby's heart to beat too hard each time.  The baby doesn't die from a heart 
attack, it dies from cardiac arrest, in other words, the little heart is so tired that it just can't beat another beat and it  
just stops. 
 
That is the cause, and it's caused generally because the mother doesn't give the baby enough water to drink because 
there's nothing about it in the baby books.  Most of the baby books say to give the baby liquids, not water, and 
liquids don't necessarily wash out the ureas but clean water does. 
 
In researching this aspect of cot deaths Doc said, 
"I have tested many, many babies who were brought into the hospital, dead from crib death and when the 
doctors could find nothing wrong every one of th em had a urinary ureas reading of 30.  Not every cot 
death had a high ureas because some of them were smothered and so on, but most of them had that urea 
reading of 30.  Every baby that died from cardiac arrest had a ureas reading of 30 and that is why I h ave 
established 30 as the number at which life will cease very quickly and that's cardiac arrest either in a heart 
attack, or in a crib death or in school. 
 
Now if you see a patient that has an extremely high urea the first thing you'd need to do is have t hem drink water to 
wash it out, and one of the first things you'd do with their foods is take them off high protein foods like meats and 
put them on low protein foods and lots of sprouts.  Keep them on the high water until the ureas go below 20, then in 
addition to the water use dolomite according to their weight and age.  Although dolomite is not available to the body 
as a calcium it is a magnesium catalyst that will cause the undigested proteins to be thrown out of your system in 
order to prevent a heart attack, and this is the time when you use it.  It will drop the undigested proteins in soluble 
forms which were overstimulating your heart, causing the heart to beat too hard and therefore asking for a heart 
attack. 
 
Now there are times when you shouldn't drink the water that you're supposed to, for instance, suppose you had low 
blood sugar, and you had a high ureas, and you started to drink water, then you'd go into a coma.  So if you have 
high ureas, and a low sugar, then you're going to have to use lemon ade or some other juice along with it in order to 
get it down and many times if it's a juice it's going to draw from your own fat until it won't drop down.  But the 
important point that you need to remember is to keep the sugars up while getting the ureas down. 
 
A man had a urea of 25 and was taken off of meat for at least 8 weeks, and there was no cheating, but after all that 
time he still had high ureas.  His pH's were away from normal and if that's the case even any medium to heavy 
protein will still leave residue behind.  The body can only do 3 things as we understand it: 
 digest (or attempt to), and utilise, 
 digest (or attempt to), and void, 
 digest (or attempt to), and store.

In his case it stored the ureas and was releasing them when his system was ab le to handle to load.  Many people who 
have been called arthritics after they've been on distilled water for a while the water flushes it out and they weren't 
true arthritics at all, they were the victims of stored excess calcium.  I haven't yet seen the u reas fail to move once 
you: 
 work on the pH, and 
 remove part of the source of the problem. 
 
because there are two parts to his problem: 
 the food he's eating, and 
 the rate at which it's digesting. 
 
Take away the food he's eating and substitute, and change the rate at which it's digesting, then the urea has to 
change.  Remember he might only be eating meat once a week but if he's eating meat once a week and not digesting 
it correctly he's still creating urea.  If the undigested protein stays in the body for 3 days and not being completely 
utilised it gets stored in the form of urea. 
 
Potassium Deficiency 
 
Now let's look at what happens when the ureas are lower than they should be.  
 
With the ureas number the first test is most important.  On a first analysis, on a first analysis, don't forget, on a first 
analysis, if the sum of the ureas is: 
 15 There may be an ever so slight potassium deficiency, depending on weight. 
 13 There may be a potassium deficiency, depending on weight, 
 12 Definite and noticeable potassium deficiency, 
 11 Early stages of 220 case, look at the other numbers 
 9 Definite 220 case.  The tumor has formed and it's not a minor problem, it's a major problem and those 
people should be gotten into the retreat at the earliest date possible.  They may look perfectly healthy as 
though there's nothing wrong and about the only thing that they will notice, and sometimes they don't 
notice it because it depends on where it is in the brain, that they are absentminded or forgetful.  
 8 Serious 220 case 
 7 Very serious case. 
 
Now if they have a 220 case and an acute low sugar, less than 1.0, then it's very noticeable, but if they have a higher 
"low blood sugar", say 1.4 to 5.4 then many times they don't notice it as much.  But remember also that the sugar 
zone from 2.0 to 5.49 is called the "Zone of Misery". 
 
Now suppose that you have a urea test with a total of 10 and all the other numbers are way out of line.  You'll need 
to ask some questions for any time the urea is from 10 - 13, and the questions you'll ask are: 
 Are you working quite hard? 
 Are you very busy? 
 Do you work long hours? 
 Are you a hard worker? 
 Are you a busy bee?  I don't mean trouble maker, I mean they work like crazy.  
 
One of the signs of a brain tumor is a person works, works, works like a machine, they never slow down because it 
seems that nature knows that their time is short and they're trying to turn out as much work as possible, they work 
like crazy and the urea keeps dropping until it's down to about 7 or 8 and they're in serious condition and all of a 
sudden they either have a heart attack or they run out of "get up and go", their go has gone, they can't go, and this is 
a potassium deficiency. 
 
A 220 Case is a term in math for a brain tumor, and as you get into this you're going to find that br ain tumors appear 
at other places besides below ureas of 12.  You may find people with brain tumors where the total urea is 22, 23, 24, 
or 25 but it's a different kind of condition.  Right now it's suffice to say if it's a first test and the ureas are belo w 12, 
if there's a picture, that they have a potassium deficiency and the worse the potassium deficiency and the longer 
they've had it the greater the chance of a brain tumor.

With a potassium deficiency, and a true reading, the greater the deficiency the  less people are able to function.  If on 
a first test you find a 7, and all other numbers are way out and yet the person walked into your office looking good 
and alert then that may not be a true reading, they may be in a slight withdrawal from recent cha nges in things like: 
 Diet.  They may have read a diet book and be trying it. 
 Living location.  They may have just moved house. 
 Personal circumstances.  They may have just gone on holidays. 
 
and you'll need to etablish by questions what is happening.  
 
Magnesium 
 
But whatever the reading remember the rule, magnesium is the greatest enemy that nitrogen ever had" and while 
magnesium in dolomite form is used with high ureas it is never used when the ureas are below 15.  Do not use 
dolomite until the ureas get a bove 15.  One no -no is never, never, never use dolomite or magnesium when you have 
a 220 case, a brain tumor, because it will aggravate the condition. 
 
Withdrawal 
 
Now whenever the body chemistry is going through a withdrawal the urea will drop below 12 and this is one way to 
tell when a body chemistry is in withdrawal is that the urea will be below 12 along with the other numbers, or way 
below normal, below perfect is what I'm saying. 
 
Now as soon as it rises above 12 again it means that they are finishe d their withdrawal and that they're ready for a 
light diet, and this is very, very important. 
 
Now, as soon as it rises above light diet on a normal case, and they're over their three day light diet and back on food 
toward normal, and had a week for stabil isation for numbers so that you can give them an intelligent diet, then I 
would start an Adult, weighing 100 lb or more on 1000 units of vitamin E twice a day because vitamin E thins the 
blood and the delta cells that are being thrown out so rapidly thickens the blood so thick until it overworks the heart. 
 
Now on a FIRST test you find a urea 24 or above and you put a stethoscope on the heart it's a very loud, beating 
very hard and you've heard doctors say you're heart is strong as a horse's heart.  All the y were saying is about to 
have a heart attack, a pectoris heart attack. 
 
But then you watch this recovery after the withdrawal and then you still got the high urea, put the stethescope back 
on the heart and it'll sound like a kitty cat walking on eggs, sof t, easy normal beat, not beating too hard.  Now if this 
undigested urea, which is really worn out cells that are very high in protein, stay in the body for three days they'll 
turn to a salt and this salt then turns to a urea which overstimulates the heart and causes it to beat too hard and this is 
why it's very good for these cells to be thrown out at a very rapid rate for months, for the rebuilding of all the cells in 
the body. 
 
Now one more thing about this urea, it generally creeps up on you so slowly un til you can have a fatal heart attack 
and think you're perfectly alright.  There's no symptoms that an individual can really connect to it, however the 
tester can see telltale symptoms.  
If the condition of high ureas exists it's only going to be a matter of time until it's going to have an effect upon the 
other numbers, for example, let's take a person 40 years old and he has a 23 urea then it's only then a matter of time 
until he's gonna either have a major or a fatal heart attack, depending on the other numbers.

URINE & SALIVA ANALYSIS 
 
 
HOW TO CONDUCT THE TEST 
AND 
FIND THE NUMBERS 
 
 
Equipment Needed 
 
The following equipment is needed to conduct the Urine & Saliva analysis: 
 Refractometer, 
 pH Reagents or pH Meter, 
 Colour Cards for pH reagents, 
 Conductivity Meter, 
 Reagent 1, Universal Extract Solution, 
 Reagent 2, Sulfuric Acid based Reagent for Nitrate Nitrogen, 
 Reagent 3, Potassium Hydroxide based Reagent for Ammoniacal Nitrogen,  
 Colour Cards for Nitrate Nitrogen and Ammoniacal Nitrogen, 
 6-Well Spotting Plate, 
 5 ml mixing crucible, or 1 dram vial 
 5 Pasteur Pipettes with rubber bulbs, 
 Pipette Holder, 5 Pipette 
 Penlight Torch, 
 100 cc Graduated Cyliner, 
 3 cc Syringes, and 
 180 ml Specimen Cups, Clear. 
 
In addition you'll need a quantity Bicarbonate of Soda, distilled water and rubbing alcohol for cleaning agents.  
 
Laboratory Rules 
 
The following are rules to help ensure that all the test readings are clear and accurate. 
 
 Clean Equipment.  As you work with this equipment keep it absolutely clean. 
 Reagent Bottles.  Never leave a bottle open.  If you take a substance out of a bottle 10,000 times in one 
day, close it every time.  Close it every time you've finished with it.  The reagents are highly caustic and 
if you spill them they'll burn. 
 Pipettes.  When conducting the analysis never drop your pipettes into the urine sample or reagent bott les, 
put them down easy or it cracks the tip or breaks the end off and consequently the drop is not the standard 
size drop and it gives you a wrong reading. 
 
Leaving aside AGE, HEIGHT and WEIGHT, the "PERFECT" test numbers are:  
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.40 saliva_ph=6.40 conductivity=6 - 7 C cell_debris=.04M nitrate_nitrogen=3 ammonia_nitrogen=3
 
We will go through each of these numbers in turn covering the instrument that's used and showing how the reading 
is made.

Carbohydrate 
 
The first number is the "Total Carbohydrates" and is most often referred to as "Suga rs". 
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.4 saliva_ph=6.4 conductivity=6 - 7 C cell_debris=.04M nitrate_nitrogen=3 ammonia_nitrogen=3
 
The REFRACTOMETER is the instrument used to measure the total carbohydrate content of the urine, and the units 
of measurement are BRIX.  In addition to measuring the sugars in the urine it can also be used to measure the sugar 
content of anything you want, and in the agricultural course this instrument is used to measure the sugar content of 
vegetable juices like beans, carrots, oranges, apples, bananas and so forth.  It will measure the sugar content of any 
liquid. 
 
The best refractometer to use has a little thermometer on the outside that reads a tolerance figure from -1 through 0 
to +1, but you don't use that small thermometer scale unless the main sugar reading is below 1.0 brix.  
 
When you purchase this instrument m ake sure that you read and understand the manufacturer's instructions, 
especially the parts that deal with care, cleaning, maintenance and adjustments. 
 
To get the main sugar reading lift the flap over the plate, take a little of the specimen in a clean pi pette and put it 
right on the plate and fold the flap back over.  This pipette is also used to put 1 drop of urine in the mixing crucible.  
Hold the instrument up to the light and when you look inside you can see the sugar reading.  
 
Now there are two adjustments on the instrument, first is the focus.  Adjust the eyepiece until the view of the scale is 
clear.  Now you may also see what looks like a rainbow inside which has a line with green at the bottom then a little 
blue then purple and a hazy line up and down.  There's a little adjusting ring that you turn back and forth, if you turn 
it one way the inner line goes red whereas if you turn it the other way it goes blue green and right in the middle is a 
line going straight across. 
 
If the reading is not clear it might also be because it has a little shutter in front to shut out some of the light, so adjust 
it according to the light you're looking into. 
 
If the reading goes below 1.0 then you look at the thermometer on the outside and you add or subtract whate ver is on 
there and that is the tolerance figure. 
 
In a case where the inner reading came to 0.5 brix, and the tolerance reading was +0.4 you add the inner reading and 
the tolerance reading together which gives your final reading as 0.9. 
 
pH 
 
The next two readings are the pH of the urine and the pH of the saliva.  The urine pH is always written in the top 
position and the saliva pH is written in the bottom position. 
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.4 saliva_ph=6.4 conductivity=6 - 7 C cell_debris=.04M nitrate_nitrogen=3 ammonia_nitrogen=3
 
The pH can be measured in one of two ways, either by: 
 Chemical reagent, or 
 Instrument. 
 
The chemical reagents used are: 
 Bromcresol Green for pH between 3.8 to 5.4 
 Chlorphenol Red for pH between 5.2 to 6.8 
 Bromthymol Blue for pH between 6.0 to 7.6, and 
 Phenol Red for pH between 6.8 to 8.4 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================
PAGE 64
============================================================

 
 
64 
When using the chemical reagents put 1 drop of urine in each of 4 wells on the spotting plate.  Start by adding 1 
drop of Bromthymol Blue to 1 well and read the pH off the colour chart provided with the reagent.  Do not make a 
reading by fluorescent light because you  get a very, very poor colour from fluorescent light, use natural light if you 
can, or if you can't then use incandescent, but try to avoid fluorescent light:  
 If the colour goes blue, indicating out of range in the alkaline direction, then next use the Phe nyl Red to 
zero in on the pH. 
 If the colour goes yellow, indicating out of range in the acid direction, then next use the Chlorphenol Red.  
If the Chlorphenol Red also goes out of range in the acid direction then use the Bromcresol Green.  
 If the colour for the Bromthymol Blue is within scale, that is between 6.0 and 7.6, then use the appropriate 
Chlorphenol Red or Phenol Red to verify the Bromthymol Blue reading. 
 
If the readings do not concur then run the test again. 
 
If an electronic instrument is used th en read, understand and follow the manufacturer's directions on use, care, 
maintenance and adjustments. 
 
Salinity or Salts 
 
(Note: the conductivity procedure has been updated from that originally given.  The original procedure was the 
dilute method, but with advancing technology, an undiluted procedure was later agreed to by Carey Reams and 
included an “adjusting” denominator – explained later.) 
 
The conductivity or salt reading, referred to as "salts", is the next number.  
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.40 saliva_ph=6.40 conductivity=6 - 7 C cell_debris=.04M nitrate_nitrogen=3 ammonia_nitrogen=3
 
In measuring the salt content, or conductivity, of the urine you use an electronic "Conductivity Meter" that measures 
conductivity in "MICROMHOS" or "MICROSIEMENS", i.e. in the range of 10 -6.  This raw conductivity reading 
then needs to be “converted” to a “C” reading.  Perfect salts are between 6-7C (see above in red). 
 
There are two methods that can be used to measure the "salts": 
 Dilute (which is the original), and 
 Concentrated (a method determined later by Bob Pike and Carey Reams). 
 
As with all electronic equipments, read and understand the manufacturer's instructions on the use, care, maintenance 
and adjustments of the meter and pay particular attention to the “temperature” setting.  A thermometer is an essential 
requirement if the meter has an adjustable temperature dial because a sample’s temperature will vary from 980F 
(370C) downwards depending on the time the sample has been sitting, its volume and the ambient temperature.  
 
The advantages of the dilute method are: 
 It is the method devised and used by Reams for many years - it is the most accurate measuring method and is 
subject to the least error, 
 It may be the only way to run the test where there is a small amount of urine , e.g., from a baby, an animal or 
even someone who’s incontinent. 
 
While the advantages of accuracy and reliability are the main drawcard, the main disadvantages of the dilute method 
are that: 
 It is significantly slower as it takes more time to run, 
 Temperature is more variable so a thermometer is more necessary for an accurate temperature setting, and 
 The ratio of pure, de-ionized water to urine is critically important. 
 
Dilute Method .  To use the dilute method take a 100 cc graduated cylinder and put a small amount of pure 
deionized water in the bottom.  Add an accurate amount of 21/2 cc of urine to it then fill the cylinder up to 90 cc so 
that you have 21/2 cc of urine and 871/2 cc of deionized water (a urine to water ratio of 1:35  exactly).  Mix well.  The

65 
reason for the small amount of water, then urine, then the remai ning water is to assist in the mixing process.  If you 
can't get deionized water then use a good, high quality, distilled water. 
 
If you can't get some small syringes to measure the urine then it takes 20 drops by a standard Pasteur pipette to make 
1 cc, so 50 standard drops will make 21/2 cc's. 
 
Carefully place the probe into the dilute solution until the hole is about 10 m m’s under the surface and gently tap it 
to release any air.  Take the reading in micromhos (or microsiemens) and multiply the result by  .0406 to give the 
unadjusted reading.  Divide by 100 to give "C" units. 
 
Alternatively, and roughly, take the reading in micromhos or microsiemens, multiply the reading by 4 and divide by 
100.  There is little difference in being super accurate and roughly accurate.  For instance, if your microsiemens 
reading on the LCD display is 250, then: 
 multiplying by .0406 gives 10.15C, and 
 multiplying by 4, then dividing by 100 gives 10C. 
 
A minimal difference. 
 
Note: "C" is only a shorthand figure and is the Roman letter for 100.  In measuring the salts you only take a reading 
to the nearest 100 microsiemens, or 1 "C".  So 600 to 700 Micromhos or Microsiemens is 6 to 7 C.  When recording 
the salinity reading do not record the letter "C", just use the number, say 10. 
 
The concentrated method is far quicker but is also subject to a greater error.  To take the reading first check the 
temperature and set the dial accordingly.  Next immerse the probe into the specimen and gently tap the probe to 
remove all the air then take the reading in microsiemens.  Divide the result by 700. 
 
For instance, a reading of 7000 microsiemens divided by 700 gives 10C for which a 10 is recorded.  When working 
with the concentrated method it is often helpful to have a conversion chart handy per the example below: 
 
Note: 700 microsiemens = 0.7 millisiemens so you need to watch your meter scale.  
 
"C" mS "C" mS "C" mS "C" mS "C" mS

5 3.5 10 7.0 15 10.5 20 14.0 25 17.5 
 
Albumin 
 
Your albumin, cellular waste, or delta cells are the natural base exchange in cells, and when you're healthy and 
drinking the correct amount of water then an adult should throw out 40, 000 millilitres, or .04 M, of dead cells with 
each litre of urine, and if you throw out more than that something is seriously wrong.  
 
Many times the albumin reading is higher than 4 M, and I've seen it like soup, but above 4 M it's all the same, we 
just quit counting at 4 M.  M is short for Million.  (Note: later procedures take note of the particles above 4M).  
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.40 saliva_ph=6.40 conductivity=6 - 7 C cell_debris=.04M nitrate_nitrogen=3 ammonia_nitrogen=3
 
The albumin reading is the most subjective reading of the whole test procedure.  When you hold the urine specimen 
up to the light and look in it you'll probably see some foreign particles floating around in there.  Those particles are 
albumin but there are many more that can't be seen.

Hold the penlight torch to the side of the specimen and shine t he beam through it.  You'll see particles in the urine 
shining like little diamonds and they are cellular particles that make up the albumin so the reading of .04M means 
40, 000 particles per litre.  When recording the reading do not record the "M".  
 
When you hold it up to the light, or use a penlight, count the particles you see and multiply them by 20 000.  After 
you get to 4 million just quit counting because it doesn't make any difference.

With the debris itself we're dealing in millions, but the main thing you want to know is, "is nature cooperating or 
isn't it cooperating", and this is actually what this reading lets us know. 
 
(Note: this procedure has been updated by the implementation of a plus system (+))  
 
Ureas Test (This procedure has been updated) 
 
The ureas test is the final part of the test equation and the ureas are the undigested proteins or the nitrogens.  There 
are two parts: 
 Nitrate Nitrogen, and 
 Ammoniacal Nitrogen. 
 
The Nitrate Nitrogen reading is the upper number and the Ammonia Nitrogen number is the lower number.  
 
Equation of health: sugars=1.5 urine_ph=6.40 saliva_ph=6.40 conductivity=6 - 7 C cell_debris=.04M nitrate_nitrogen=3 ammonia_nitrogen=3
 
When we do the ureas test we use a small mixing crucible.  Start this test as follows:  
 Using the pipette that was used to place the urine on the refractometer put 1 drop of urine into the mixing 
crucible.  You have now finished with this pipette so put it aside for cleaning. 
 Using a clean pipette put 6 drops of Reagent 1 (Universal Extract Solution) into the crucible with the drop 
of urine.  Put this pipette aside and cap the reagent bottle. 
 Using a clean pipette mix the 1 drop of urine and 6 drops of Reagent 1.  This is done by placing the end of 
the pipette in the solution and squeezing the bulb for 1 minute or 120 squeezes.  When the solution is well 
mixed put 1 drop in each of 2 fresh, clean wells in the spotting plate.  You have now fi nished with this 
pipette so put it aside for cleaning. 
 Take the Sulfuric Acid based Reagent 2 (Nitrate Nitrogen) and a clean pipette.  Into the edge of the top 
solution DROP 1 drop of Reagent 2 at the corners, north, south, east and west (or using a clock face, at 
12, 3, 6 and 9).  Do NOT place the reagent drops into the solution, let each drop fall and form as a drop 
then run down the side of the well into the edge of the solution.  Put the pipette aside and cap the reagent 
bottle. 
 This will form a blue co lour and ring pattern which will enable the Nitrate Nitrogen content to be read.  
Depending on temperature, the colour and pattern will develop over a period of 5 minutes.  The higher the 
level of Nitrate Nitrogen the darker blue the colour.  A reading ove r 10 will be indicated by colour 
forming before the last reagent drop is added.

============================================================

 While the Nitrate Nitrogen test is developing run the test for the Ammoniacal Nitrogen.  
 Using a clean pipette and the Potassium Hydroxide based Reagent 3 (Ammonia Nitrogen) int o the edge of 
the bottom solution drop 1 drop of Reagent 3 at the corners, north, south, east and west.  Do not place the 
reagent drops into the solution, let each fall and form as a drop then run down the side of the well into the 
edge of the solution.  Put the pipette aside and cap the reagent bottle. 
 This will form a yellow colour and ring pattern which will enable the Ammoniacal Nitrogen content to be 
read.  Again depending on temperature, the yellow to brown colour and pattern will develop quickly over  
a period of about 15 to 30 seconds. 
 IF THE READING IS TOO HIGH THEN THE "DILUTE PROCEDURE" (detailed below) WILL NEED 
TO BE USED. (I’ve never needed to use the dilute procedure.) 
 If you have another test to run then pipettes used for Reagents 1, 2 and 3 c an be reused from the Pipette 
Holder. 
 
Urea Dilution Procedure.   To get urea readings where the reading initially goes over maximum you use the 
dilution method and double the answer. 
 
You use one drop of your extract solution with the urine in it and one drop of straight reagent and then just shake it 
just a little bit and then use your four drops of your each solution and multiply the reading by 2.  
 
There's another way you can do it also and that is use a double amount of your extract solution and put one  drop in 
it, but that's quite a waste of your extract solution, but you can double the amount of extract solution to start with 
and add one drop to twice the amount and then multiply it by two after concentrating it for one minute.  
 
Another dilution method is to double the amount or reagent drops.  Instead of using 4 drops of the Sulfuric Acid or 
Potassium Hydroxide on a dilution you use 8 drops. 
 
Precautions and Laboratory Practice 
 
There's no use in using sub -standard, or unclean equipment when you expect , and need, perfect answers, especially 
when dealing with human life. 
 
The conduct of the analysis always requires good, solid laboratory procedures to ensure accurate readings, 
procedures that ensure: 
 equipment is kept spotlessly clean and in good order, 
 the laboratory or test area is also kept clean, tidy and in good order, and  
 unused bottles are kept capped every time you use them. 
 
One thing about using laboratory equipment is that any laboratory technician or user that's worth his salt works with 
almost no noise at all, he'll lay every piece of equipment down like it was glass, which most of it is.  You hear a 
laboratory technician making a noise and you're in the presence of a laboratory technician that handles his 
equipment poorly.  You barely hear a light ting, ting, ting  now and then as they locate the various things because 
most of the time they take a pipette out of a little bottle that it just fits, they'll reach over, pick it up, put the drops 
where they should and never look back and still put it back in the same bottle without even looking and then 
automatically get the bottle give a twist and the cap is on. 
 
Having all the laboratory equipment in the exact same spot every  time will greatly speed the completion of all the 
analyses.  In other words, be sure that every piece of equipment is placed where you can pick it up from the exact 
same spot each time and don't have it scattered all over the bench where you have to hunt for it each time.  Have an 
exact spot for every piece of equipment, and in this manner you'll do much more accurate work. 
 
You need to keep the bottles capped when not in actual use and use a specific pipette in one specific bottle.  Do not 
change your pipettes from one bottle to another, if you do you'll ruin the s olution.  You must keep each pipette 
connected with its own specific bottle and not change it from one bottle to another.  Before you change it from a 
bottle that you have emptied to a new bottle be sure that the pipette is thoroughly washed, sterilised, d ipped in 
alcohol and rewashed in distilled water and then dried before you transfer it to a next bottle.

One of the very important things is to always be sure that your pipettes, your 6 well spotting plates and other vials 
are clean.  Wash your equipment every time you use it and it must go through the following baths: 
 Plain Water bath for a quick rinse and wash. 
 Soda Bath of a strong solution of Bicarbonate of Soda.  Wash for at least 30 seconds, or soak in it, and 
then rub it with your finger until it's squeaky clean, until it's no longer slick.  It just doesn't go through a 
soda bath otherwise it'll form a plastic-like film over the platelet and you'll come up with a cloudy reading 
that no-one can interpret.  If you have a urea reading that's too cloudy it's because your equipment is not 
clean. 
 Plain Water bath, to rinse off the Bicarbonate of Soda. 
 Alcohol Bath, wood alcohol, ordinary rubbing alcohol. 
 Distilled Water or Pure Water, and then sling the water off or out of it, and 
 Alcohol Bath , and if the a lcohol sticks to the surfaces of the pipettes, plates or vials they're not clean.  
The alcohol bath is so it dries quicker. 
 
If the equipment is not clean it will not give you a clear, concise reading and it can even give you a lower pH 
reading than it rea lly is.  To make sure it's clean you can use your Chlorphenol Red.  Have some in a check 
container and pick that up into your pipette and if it changes colour your pipette isn't clean.  When you drop it onto 
your plate and swish it around a bit if it begin s to change colour around the edge it's contaminated.  If it's got one 
contaminating cation in there it'll change colour.  If it doesn't change colour put it back into your check container but 
even then the plate and pipette goes through the water bath and then the alcohol bath again. 
 
If you have a reading in which the colour is not according to your instruction then the equipment is not clean and 
this can even start with a pipette. 
 
With your pH meter you need to check the accuracy of your reading several  times with your buffer solutions, and 
don't let it get out of range.  You've also got the same cleaning problem with the pH meters, you must keep the vials 
and probe clean, and you have to really clean that probe or you're going to get the wrong reading.  Now the best 
thing to do is put the probe into distilled water and see if you get a zero reading, and if it is, it's clean.  You don't 
clean the refractometer, pH or conductivity probes in the soda bath.  If you clean the electrodes in the soda bath the 
soda will coat it, it's better to rinse the electrode with plain water. 
 
When you travel in an aeroplane all of your equipment, and especially the reagents, should be in ziplock bags, or 
plastic bags, and tightly bound together with a rubber band. 
 
NOTE:- 1.  Each single test will require the use of 5 pipettes.  When additional tests are to be done at the same 
time then an additional 2 pipettes are required per additional test. 
 
2.  The cost of "Pasteur Pipettes" in bulk form is often so low ($12.50 per box  of 200) that it may be more 
economical to use the pipettes once only then discard them rather than clean then in bicarb, alcohol 
and distilled water.  In the same manner, the mixing crucible can be a “disposable” small 1 dram glass 
test tube vial which will eliminate cleaning.  
 
3.  Equipment (not chemicals) can be purchased from "Laboratory Supplies" at Osborne Park, Perth, or 
your local laboratory supply house. 
 
4. Lamotte chemicals were purchased from “Vendart” in Sydney.  Check with Lamotte for a local  
distributor.

PART 8 
 
A SHORT COURSE IN CHEMISTRY 
(This needs additional review) 
 
 
Introduction 
 
The Theory of Biological Ionization crosses many boundaries, but while it's main use is in analyzing the efficiency 
of the human chemistry, and monitoring what's happening, the basis of BI is in the sciences; physics, chemistry, 
biology and mathematics.  The Theory was developed by strict application of mathematics (calculus and relative 
math) and the laws of physics to the process of chemistry and biochemistry.  So, no discussion about the Theory of 
Ionization would be complete without looking at the changes it would cause in the field of chemistry, and the 
redefining of some terms to reflect a greater accuracy of meaning. 
 
Where new knowledge outstrips old definitions, as are used in current teaching, the problem arises whether to 
modify current terms and use them, or invent new terms and use those.  Whichever option is selected both have their 
own pr oblems.  The pioneers of Biological Ionization decided to use the current terms, but modified their 
definitions; redefining them to be more accurate and more specific. 
 
It used to be said that, "he who controls the atom will control the universe", but that 's not exactly true anymore.  
That saying has been refined as our knowledge increases because "he who controls the ion will control the 
universe." 
 
Atomic Particles 
 
In starting to examine the physical universe we'll start with the ion and progress to the atom then look at the energy 
in ions. 
 
An ION is the smallest particle of energy in existance, and it's so small that if one ion was enlarged to be the size of 
a golf ball then the next nearest ion would be 1730 miles, or 2780 kilometers, (or roughly the d istance between Perth 
and Melbourne as the crow flies).  The term "ion" is non specific because there are two types of ions, anions and 
cations, one negative and one positive and it is the association of anions and cations in a specific ratio that actually  
forms the core and outer shell of an ATOM.  If you change the ratio of structure between the core and shell you 
change the nature and synchronization of the atom.  In other words, a change in electrons is a change in element, an 
element being all of one synchronized substance, like iron, gold, carbon etc.. 
 
An ANION is the smallest particle of energy and is negative.  A CATION is the second smallest particle of energy 
and is positive.  Anions and cations are energy, and energy has many different forms and kinds and shapes and 
comes in many, many different patterns.  A good chemistry book will show nine different patterns of energy that a 
single atom may have.  Patterns like: 
 Cubic, face centered, 
 Cubic, body centered, 
 Cubic 
 Diamond, 
 Hexagonal 
 Orthorhombic, 
 Rhombohedral 
 Tetragonal, and 
 Monoclinic. 
 
Now the origin of all energy is elementary and an ELEMENT is any substance with the same atomic number that 
cannot be reduced to any other substance and has two or more atoms in a definite energy ratio to one anoth er.  In 
other words, the anions and cations have synchronized to a single energy pattern and the synchronization has 
become equal.

============================================================
PAGE 70
============================================================

 
If you could blow the anions and cations up big enough to see them with the naked eye they would look something 
like the parts of a 3D jigsaw puzzle, in other words energy is not all the same shape and form, and it's the different 
shapes and form of energy that makes things different and it is these actual energy particles that may or may not 
become a part of you. 
 
For instance, the parts of a Volkswagon will not fit a Ford because they're the wrong shape and it is the same with 
the particles of energy.  Energy shapes are different just like the parts of a Volkswagon or a Holden or Ford are 
different shapes.  The shapes of the atoms and of the anionic and cationic molecules that we're made from are also 
different shapes.  While energy in it's simple, elemental form has nine patterns, energy in its compound form has 
many, many thousands, even millions, of different shapes. 
 
For instance, an apple is different from an apricot or a peach or a green bean because they're made out of different 
kinds of energy, different size particles.  A fig is different from an olive because there's a difference in the shap e of 
the particles of the energy that each are made from and this is what makes one thing different from another, is the 
shape of the energy in the matrix.  For instance, when you smell a flower, you're smelling some loss of energy from 
that flower, and when that particle of energy strikes the little nerve endings in your nose and short circuits them you 
say, "that's the scent of a rose", or, "that's the scent of a violet" when you smell a violet, or when you smell a skunk 
that's a part of that skunk's energy that's been lost. 
 
So whatever the odor is it's a part of that energy that you're smelling, and this is also the size that food must be in 
order to have it even available, or with a possible availability, of being put onto your frequency down to the mil li 
micron of our own body chemistry, or else it can't become a part of you. 
 
Still looking at the structure of the atom, the term ELECTRON is also a non specific term because an electron is the 
energy in the outer orbit, or outer shell, of an atom and an e lectron can be either anionic electron or cationic electron, 
either positive or negative electrons. 
 
When using the terms ION and ELECTRON, the difference is such that ION generally refers to the atomic core and 
ELECTRON refers to the outer shell, but it c an be either.  For example, in an isotope you may have a cation as the 
ion or an anion as the ion, or vice versa.  An ISOTOPE is when the energy particles in the ion and electron change 
places.  The very fact that we have isotopes makes chemistry complicat ed and because nature and energy will follow 
THE LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE  it means that certain elements have the power to theoretically, and do, 
change from one side to the other.  In other words, the isotope is going to be on the "winning" side, the side  with the 
greatest magnetic pull because the Line of Least Resistance is along the line of greatest magnetic pull.  When you 
look at an isotopic atom there's a constant change from the "centre" to "out" and "out" to the "centre" and that makes 
it a balanced isotope. 
 
When something is IONIZED it means that something has been added to the ion.  You can add the same thing, for 
instance, you can add gold to more gold, or you can take copper and add gold to it and have a gold plate.  In other 
words, to ionize something is to add something to a substance.  In the same way to de ionize something means to take 
something away, and when you put the words together you get IONIZATION, and that means how things are put 
together and how they're taken apart.  Ionization is the moving of particles from a negative pole to a positive pole, 
and the unhindered rate of ionization is the speed of light and is 186 400 miles per second. 
 
Try to keep the Theory of Ionization as simple as possible, as small particles moving from a neg ative origin to a 
positive collecting point, as particles collecting in the heart, in the brain, in the eyes, in the toenails, in the bones, in  
the tissue and the many different secretions in the body.  The Biological Theory of Ionization is the same theory that 
takes place in a silver plating, nickel plating, chromium plating tank, and IN THE BODY YOU CANNOT 
CORRECT THE CONDITION THROUGH THE DIET UNLESS YOU KNOW THE POINT OF ORIGIN AND 
KNOW THE ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO MANUFACTURE THE SUBSTANCE NEEDED AT THE POINT 
OF LOSS OF ENERGY, WHICH IS THE MALADY.  The liver is the origin of the stomach's HCl and it moves the 
ionized particles that comprise it, a little bit at a time, to the storage sacs of the stomach, and all of this does not go 
through the bloodstream , some of it goes direct and some of it goes by the ionization that takes place within our 
bodies.  The little particles in this solution start off as a negative charge but as they come to the collecting point they 
accumulate and, being a relative matter, many of them form between the point of origin and the point of collecting 
but they're still manufactured at the point of origin.  For instance, thyrotoxin and thyroxine are both cationic 
substances and are not made in the liver. 
 
So it is through this that we can predict anywhere from minutes to months or years in advance where disease is going 
to strike, and it is through this that we know where the malady is going to strike.  For instance, suppose you had a

four year old child and the child had a potassiu m deficiency, it wouldn't take any great amount of brains to know a 
brain tumor was developing, or suppose you had a child with a carbohydrate reading of 8 or 9, it wouldn't take any 
great amount of brains to know that the child was going to be a diabetic if you didn't correct that condition. 
 
So corrective action for these conditions should begin at the earliest point of discovery, even in childhood.  Do not 
wait until the disease knocks you down or makes it absolutely impossible for you to go, and then do  something about 
it.  Parents should be taught that when children misbehave there may be a biological reason for it.  
 
There is a specific difference between an anion and a cation, and the difference is determined by an oscilloscope and 
occurs in the direct ion of rotation and the energy levels.  Leaving the energy levels aside for the moment, an anion 
rotates clockwise and a cation rotates anticlockwise, simple as that.  Also in relation to electrical charge, an anion is 
a negative charge and a cation is a positive charge. 
 
An ATOM is a particle that contains anions and cations.  The atom may have either: 
 a cationic core and anionic shell (positive core and negative electrons), or 
 an anionic core and cationic shell, (negative core and positive electrons). 
 
An atom is either a cation or anion all by itself and it doesn't have to be divided to become ionic.  In other words, it 
does not borrow a charge from another element to make it ionic, although it may borrow some energy units, or pick 
them up again. 
 
There a re nuclear physicists and particle physicists who claim to have found many new particles when they have 
bombarded the atom but what they have really found, but not identified properly, is the loss of energy from the atom.  
They have picked up the loss and change of energy in it, and the energy is either a negative or positive, or anion or 
cation, or proton or neutron which is saying the same thing in three different ways, and they are trying to classify at 
certain levels the difference in a substance, like water.  For instance, the purest of water, pure H 2O, does NOT all 
weigh the same, there's all kinds of pure water, not including the compounds in water either.  For instance, you have 
heavy water, you have light water, you have dry water and then you have just water, and it's a variation of the energy 
of your anions and cations that make it up.  The lower the energy number of the anion and electrons in water the 
drier the water, the greater the energy number the heavier the water. 
 
The atomic number of an e lement is the position of that element in the PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS , and 
the ATOMIC WEIGHT  of an element is determined by the number of electrons AND the number of units of 
energy per cation or anion, or you can say the atomic weight is the frequency of an element, and is also the atomic 
energy in a given space.  So in working with the Periodic Table of Elements the greater the atomic weight the greater 
the frequency.  The atomic weight gives the total number of cations and anions in the outer and inne r shell of any 
substance. 
 
All elementary and compound atoms are made of cations and anions and it's now time to break a theory in chemistry 
that is commonly taught.  Most people were, and are, taught that an atom had to have the same number of protons as 
electrons, for instance, the taught configuration of some well known elementary atoms is:  
 Hydrogen (H)  1 Proton, 0 Neutrons, 1 Electron 
 Carbon (C)  6 Protons, 6 Neutrons, 6 Electrons 
 Nitrogen (N)  7 Protons, 7 Neutrons, 7 Electrons 
 Oxygen (O)  8 Protons, 8 Neutrons, 8 Electrons 
 Sodium (Na)  11 Protons, 12 neutrons, 11 Electrons  
 Phosphorus (P)  15 Protons, 16 Neutrons, 15 Electrons 
 Chlorine (Cl)  17 Protons, 18 Neutrons, 17 Electrons 
 Potassium (K)  19 Protons, 20 Neutrons, 19 Electrons 
 Calcium (Ca)  20 Protons, 20 Neutrons, 20 Electrons 
 Manganese (Mn)  25 Protons, 30 Neutrons, 25 Electrons  
 Arsenic (As)  33 Protons, 42 Neutrons, 33 Electrons 
 Iodine (I)  53 Protons, 74 Neutrons, 53 Electrons 
 
The current teaching for chemistry is wrong and it has been taught incorrectly for many years.  For instance, any 
time in math, or physics, or chemistry, that you have a ratio of 1:1 you have the same thing.  In chemistry you were 
taught that you had to ha ve the same number of protons as electrons, or as we say, the same number of cations as 
anions. Hydrogen has one proton and one electron, or one cation and one anion, a ratio of 1:1.  Therefore anything 
that has the ratio of 1:1 should be hydrogen because nature would follow the Line of Least Resistance to make it so.  
Therefore, if oxygen had 8 protons and 8 electrons the physics of that structure would follow the line of least

resistance and break it down to be 8 atoms of hydrogen.  But since that doesn't  happen it means that either nature 
doesn't follow the Line of Least Resistance or the currently taught atomic theory in chemistry is wrong.  Since nature 
does follow the Line of Least Resistance it can only be that the current atomic model is incorrect.  
 
In considering the energy and structure of atoms Carey Reams said, 
"When I finished at college and got my Doctor of Science degree I could not figure energy in anything and 
I was taught just like you were taught, I did not know how, and when I got out into  the field to work I fell 
flat on my face, I absolutely almost went insane for about three years trying to figure out what was wrong.  
You cannot figure energy as long as you have a ratio of 1:1, it's impossible, it cannot be done.  So finally, 
in desperation, I went to private teachers who taught me how to figure energy, and to teach me the basic 
foundations of figuring energy I was charged US$50.00 an hour back in the Great Depression.  In other 
words, they taught me the foundation of figuring energy.  Dr . Charles Northam was the one who taught 
me how to figure this energy and taught me how wrong the books were, and he had a nice write up in the 
1937 Readers Digest.  So what I'm saying to you is forget what you've been taught in the past and now just 
take it like it really is and I will prove this more and more as we go through it." 
 
In considering the previous list of elements and what makes each element different to the other, consider this, the 
factor that makes the elements different to each other is th e electrons in the outer orbit, that is, the ratio between 
anions and cations.  Remember, it is the electrons in the outer shell that makes one element different from another.  
For instance, it is the atomic weight (AW) that gives the ratio of anions to ca tions, and the direction of electron spin 
that gives the configuration of core and shell, such that: 
 Hydrogen (H)  (AW 1)  1 Anion, 1 Cation 
 Carbon (C)  (AW 12)  1 Anion, 12 Cations 
 Nitrogen (N)  (AW 14)  1 Anion, 14 Cations 
 Oxygen (O)  (AW 16)  1 Anion, 16 Cations 
 Sodium (Na)  (AW 23)  1 Anion, 23 Cations 
 Phosphorus (P)  (AW 31)  1 Anion, 31 Cations 
 Chlorine (Cl)  (AW 35.5) 1 Cation, 35 Anions (anionic element) 
 Potassium (K)  (AW 39.1) 1 Cation, 39 Anions (anionic element) 
 Calcium (Ca)  (AW 40.1) 1 Cation, 40 Anions (anionic element) 
 Manganese (Mn)  (AW 54.9) 1 Anion, 54 Cations 
 Arsenic (As)  (AW 74.9) 1 Anion, 74 Cations 
 Iodine (I)  (AW 126.9) 1 Anion, 126 Cations 
 
If you had a cationic element (anticlockwise electron rotation) with 1 Anion and 40 Cations you would not have 
calcium, you would have a new element that hasn't been named yet.  It would have an atomic weight of 40, the same 
as calcium, but the elementary properties would be different because the direction of electron spin is different and is 
of great importance.  The relationship between anions and cations and protons, neutrons and electrons, is:  
 Cations are protons.  A cation is the charged particle which will go to the cathode, therefore cations are 
positive therefore they are protons. 
 Anions go to the anode, therefore they are negative particles.  Neutrons are always negative.  
 Electrons can be either positive or negative, either one.  The electron is the outer shell and the atomic 
weight is the number of electrons in that outer shell. 
 
Now remember this, in all of our foods there's only three anionic, elements: 
 Chlorine,  
 Potassium, and 
 Calcium. 
 
Calcium is anionic and has 1 cation (nucleus) and 40 anions (electrons) - negative electrons 
In contrast, Carbon is cationic and has 1 anion (nucleus) and 12 cations (electrons) - positive electrons 
 
If you then consider the isotopes: 
 Hydrogen, 
 Helium, 
 Nitrogen, and 
 Oxygen. 
 
The remaining elements of nutritional interest are cationic.

Now calcium is always anionic, or alkaline, and there's no exception.  If you were to combine anionic calcium with, 
say, cationic sulfuric acid in a test tube then the calcium will appear to be cationic, or acid, but it is still calcium and 
calcium is alwa ys an anionic substance, anywhere, anytime, any place, on the bottom of the ocean, in the ocean 
water, in the soil, in a seashell, or anywhere else, it is constant.  The calcium is an anionic substance because the 
electrons in orbit always rotate clockwise.   
 
Introduction to Ionic Energy 
 
At this stage we'll move a little deeper into the actual energy configuration of anions and cations.  
 
An anion is the smallest unit of energy and has a variable energy rating between 1 - 499 Milhouse Units such that 
each one anion may contain from 1 to 499 MHU and still be referred to as one anion.  In other words, the smallest 
anion in existence has 1 MHU and the largest anion there is has 499 MHU.  A single anion is so small that it cannot 
be divided, halved or quartered  and if you are to try to comprehend what an anion is with its variable powers of 
energy you must think of the smallest anion as a container with 1 marble in it, and the largest anion as another 
container with  499 marbles in it.  Now you can divide these marbles by computer anyway you want to but each 
anion is just like each container and you can't halve, quarter or third that container.  Each anion comes in wholes and 
we refer to them all as anion regardless of the MHU that they contain between 1 and 499.   In discussions or 
calculations about molecular power we use the average anion of 250 MHU.  
 
The cation is the second smallest unit of energy and has a variable energy rating between 500 and 999 Milhouse 
Units and, using the law of averages, the average va riable of energy for a cation is 750 MHU.  In considering the 
average energy value of one average atom of hydrogen with one anion and one cation would be 1000 MHU.  
 
The greater the number of Milhouse Units of energy in an atom, the greater the atomic weigh t. 
 
Hydrogen, the Simple Element?? 
 
The lightest Hydrogen atom possible has 1 MHU per anion and 500 MHU per cation totalling 501 MHU.  
The heaviest Hydrogen atom possible has 499 MHU per anion and 999 MHU per cation totalling 1498 MHU.  
 
All elementary and c ompound atoms are made out of anionic and cationic energy and when you consider the 
variables in the energy levels, 999 differentials, you are beginning to peep through the keyhole into the makeup of 
the universe.  These energy numbers are actually introdu cing you to a field of mathematics that is so vast it's 
incomprehensible in it's overall pattern because you can take an ordinary deck of cards with 50 cards in it and there's 
over three million (3 000 000) different plays that can be made with just 50 car ds.  Now here you have 1999 and all of 
the differentials that could be made with that and you know what you have?  You have a universe on your hands.  
You have everything in the universe to deal with, all matter, all substance, all gas, all air, and all th e oceans and 
everything else that's made from anions and cations.  There's nothing made that is made without them and this is the 
start of the power that you'll have in your hands to bring help and aid people to have better health.  
 
 
ACID and BASE 
 
Conventional teaching is that a base is an alkaline with a pH over 7.0 and an acid has a pH under 7.0.  This is not 
always true and is therefore false teaching.  The real difference between acid and base is the direction the electrons 
travel in the molecule.  In a base the electrons travel in a clockwise direction and in an acid the electrons travel in an 
anticlockwise direction.  That is the only reason that any substance is a base or an acid and there is no other reason at 
all.  The difference between an ACID an d a BASE (Base = Alkaline), is determined by the direction of spin of the 
electrons in the outer shell of an atom.  In an acid the electrons travel counterclockwise, while in an alkaline, or base, 
the electrons travel clockwise - it's as simple as that.  S o a cation is an acid and an anion is a base, and that has 
everything in the world to do with digesting your foods. 
 
In explaining acid and alkaline, cation and anion, Carey Reams said, 
"One person in the very first Biological Ionization course tested lemon juice and said, "doctor, there's 
something wrong with your teaching, lemon juice has a pH of 5.80." 
I said, "So what?" 
He said, "Well that's an acid." 
I said, "It is not." 
"Well, it is acid, isn't it?" 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================
PAGE 74
============================================================

 
I said, "No, it's not acid.  Remember your pH is a measure of resistance, please don't confuse it." 
 
So remember, pH is a measure of resistance, it is not a volumetric reading.  You've been taught that if the pH is 
above 7.0 it's alkaline and if it's below 7.0 it's acid but that is not tr ue, in it's broad sense it is, but in it's exact sense 
it's a measure of resistance, and when you know how to take those numbers and to untangle them and unravel them it 
means something.  But if you take lemon juice, test it and find the pH to be below 7.0  don't think that it's acid, it is 
alkaline.  The pH measures the resistance between the anions and the cations, and that's all pH is.  Now in a broad 
sense it means that you either need one or the other, or are deficient in one or the other, or you use on e or the other to 
bring the resistance in a range so that the right amount of energy can be given off at the right time on the frequency 
down to the milli milli micron that you can use.  The pH has nothing to do with the direction in which the electron 
travels, nothing. 
 
For years it's been taught that hydrochloric acid (HCl) is an acid, but using the rotation characteristics of anions and 
cations it turns out that HCl is really a base because the electrons travel in a clockwise direction according to the 
oscilloscope, the opposite direction to an acid, and that has everything in the world to do with digesting your foods 
and gaining energy. 
 
In considering that atoms have to link to form a molecule, let's take Hydrogen and Chlorine and see.  Remember, an 
isotope is an atom that's going to follow the Line of Least Resistance.  Hydrogen is an isotope so it'll get on the 
winning side and it doesn't matter which side it is, so therefore when hydrogen comes into the realm of chlorine 
(anionic element) it's going t o follow the Line of Least Resistance and they're going to join, H -Cl, to make a double 
anion with cation cores.  In coming together enough cations have to link, and enough anions have to link, so that the 
cation cores are held in place by the anionic elec trons.  It's like putting a fence around a bunch of white leghorn 
chickens; the cations are trying to get away but the anions are circling around them keeping them in.  
 
If Hydrochloric Acid was not a base you would not take HCl tablets to help digest your food, because the liver bile 
and gastric juice should be anionic. 
 
In summary then, an ANION: 
 is the smallest amount of energy that can be measured and has an energy range from 1 to 499 MHU.  
 is a negative charge of energy. 
 rotates clockwise. 
 is a base. 
 
A CATION: 
 is the second smallest amount of energy that can be measured and has an energy range of 500 to 999 
MHU. 
 is a positive charge of energy. 
 rotates anticlockwise. 
 is an acid. 
 
Energy Considerations 
 
Suppose that you had a minimum cation with 500 MHU, a nd it lost 1 MHU.  The remainder would be 499 MHU 
and, as that is less than 500 MHU, it becomes anionic.  The same would also apply to a 750 MHU cation that lost 
300 MHU or a 999 MHU cation that lost 500 MHU.  The remaining MHU would mean an anionic substa nce with 
say 450 MHU, or 499 MHU respectively. 
 
Now when a cation of say 500 MHU loses 1 MHU it becomes a 499 MHU anion and in becoming anionic the 
electrons automatically change their direction of rotation.  They change from cationic counterclockwise to a nionic 
clockwise. 
 
The 499 MHU anionic substance could be any combination of, say: 
 1 anion of 499 MHU, or 
 2 anions, one at 250 MHU and one at 249 MHU, or 
 3 anions, one at 100 MHU, one at 170 MHU and one 229 MHU, or 
 499 anions at 1 MHU. 
 
In all probability it would be something like the little second grader in school, when the teacher asked, "if there were 
ten quails sitting on the fence and you shot one off how many would be left?"

he said, "none", 
and the teacher said, "no, that's wrong", she said, "there'd be nine", 
he said to the teacher, "you may know your arithmetic but you don't know your quails", he said, "the rest of them 
would fly." 
 
So that's the way it is with some of these energy principles here, you may know your math but sometimes your 
chemistry doesn't work like that, sometimes when one flies more than that flies, it depends on the substance and 
other factors. 
 
Energy Calculations 
 
Part 1 - Energy Formulae 
 
Everything God does He does through the laws of energy and you can only measure the resp onse of energy in 
horsepower and so forth, but that is done first by trial and error and effort, you're not measuring the energy you're 
only setting up a rule of establishing the result of energy, like a fulcrum (or a seesaw in plain English), or pulleys, or 
ratio between gears.  You're only working up a geometrical pattern of cause and effect.  If you really and truly 
measure energy it doesn't start with the ratios it started somewhere else, from a spring, or from combustion, or from 
steam.  The other was the effect of energy, don't confuse the two.  Now all energy is not alike, and the 3 rules that 
apply are the basic principles of energy, and is Einstein's Theory of Energy:  
 Heat E1 = mc2 
 Electrical E2 = m+E1, or  E2 = m + mc2, and 
 Matter m  = E1+E2, matter 
 
Those are the 3 kinds of energy, E1 is heat, E2 is electricity and m is matter. 
 When you burn matter you get heat energy, 
 When you create friction between matter and heat you get electrical energy, and  
 matter, heat energy plus electrical energy equals matter. 
 
The mathematical equation for the energy that you live on today is E1 and E2, and the E1 and E2 start penetrating 
out through the system and get caught up by magnetism, by the process of ionization.  Whenever the combination of 
cations and ani ons come into existence matter is the result.  Matter is caused by ionization.  Matter is made by 
ionization and matter is taken apart by ionization.  These E1 and E2 are the basic foundations of the calculation of 
energy and these are the rules that you go by in dealing with energy. 
 
Energy in matter is calculated by adding the energy in the component anions and cations, for instance, a molecule of 
pure water is H2O, two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. 
 
The minimum Milhouse units, or specific gravity, of one molecule of water, using the minimum anion value of 1 and 
the minimum cation value of 500 is: 
 
Hydrogen is one anion (A) and one cation (C) and oxygen is one anion and sixteen cations.  
 
Hydrogen Hydrogen  Oxygen 
Anion 1x    1 MHU 1x    1 MHU    1x   1 MHU =    1 +    1 +       1 =       3 
MHU 
Cation 1x 500 MHU 1x 500 MHU 16x500 MHU = 500 + 500 + 8000 =  9000 
MHU 
Total =  9003 
MHU 
 
This is the minimum energy in one molecule of pure water, and this water is the lightest and driest water there is.    
 
Multiply the 9003 MHU by 5 million and you've got the minimum energy in one drop of the lightest, driest water 
there is.  As you increase the MHU's the water will become heavier and wetter.  
 
Calculating the maximum energy in one drop of pure water. 
 
Hydrogen Hydrogen Oxygen 
Anion 1x 499 MHU 1x499 MHU 1x499 MHU = 499 + 499 +    499 =  1497 MHU 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================
PAGE 76
============================================================

 
Cation 1x 999 MHU 1x999 MHU 16x999 MHU = 999 + 999 + 15984 =17982 MHU 
Total =19479 MHU 
 
Now this is the heaviest, wettest water there is and still all pure water. 
 
Within these two extremes (9003 and 19479) there is greater than 2600 differentials for each single molecule and 
you should now be able to understand the basis of the saying, "there's no two drops of water in the ocean alike, 
there's no two blades of gr ass alike, there's no two anything alike" simply because of the variables in the energy of 
the cations and anions.  You can have heavy water, light water and dry water and all between.  This is just in pure 
water and doesn't include the other elements.  Yo u see how complicated we are made and how marvellously we are 
made, and how these foods fit together. 
 
Let's take another problem working with the law of averages.  Let the anions be an average of 250 MHU and let the 
cations be an average of 750 MHU. 
Hydrogen Hydrogen Oxygen 
Anion 1x 250 MHU 1x 250 MHU 1x 250 MHU = 250 + 250 + 250 =     750 MHU 
Cation 1x 750 MHU 1x 750 MHU 16x 750 MHU = 750 + 750 + 12000 = 13 500 MHU 
Total = 14 250 MHU 
 
There's about 5 million molecules in one drop of water so multiply the number of average MHU in one molecule, 
- 14 250 MHU by 5 million and you've got the average energy in one drop of water.  
 
14 250 x 5 x 106   =    71 250 x 106  MHU or 7.125 x 1010 MHU in one drop of water. 
 
Now there are 20 000 drops in one litre = 1 kilogram = 2.2 lb or approximately 2 lb, and 1 lb is equal to 
approximately 10 000 drops . 
 
So 7.125 x 1010 x 20, 000 = 1.425 x 1015 MHU in 1 kg of water. 
 
Some people are 80% water, and some are 65% water.  There's so many different kinds of pure water, p ure H2O, that 
you can't number them, for instance there's: 
 heavy water, 
 light water, 
 wet water and 
 dry water. 
 
and all in between and so forth, but really it's as numberless as the sands on the seashore.  There's so many different 
kinds you can't number th em all, and the difference in water is due simply to the different ratios of energy in the 
anions and cations of hydrogen, and the anions and cations of oxygen. 
 
As another example let's take C 6H22O11 that's ordinary white sugar like you serve on the table , (sugars are generally 
in the form CnH2nOn and sucrose is actually C 12H22O11). Now the average MHU you'd find in 1 Mol of White Sugar, 
C12H22O11: 
 
C12 H22 O11 Tot Ions x Value = MHU 
(A) 12 x 1 = 12 22x1=22 11x1 = 11 12+22+11 45 x 250 =   11 250 
(C) 12x12=144 22x1=22 11x16=176 144+22+176 342 x 750 = 256 500 
Total = 267 750 
 
C12H22O11 or O12, either one would be correct, just a different kind of sugar. 
 
Now let's just do one more thing to this white sugar equation up here, let's add Nitrogen (N is 14).   We've got 
chlorophyll now, C-H-O-N is chlorophyll, N6 to be exact.  Adding in the nitrogen to the sugar to make chlorophyll.  
 
C6 H22 O11 Tot Ions 
A 12x 1 = 12 22x1=22 11x1 = 11 12+22+11 = 45 x 250 =        11 250 
C 12x12=144 22x1=22 11x16=176 144+22+176 =342 x 750 =      256 500 
Total =      267 750 
Plus Nitrogen N6

              N6 
A 6 x 1    =  6     6 x 250 =         1  500 
C 6 x 14  =  84     84 x 750 =        63  000 
Total =        64  500 
 
Total for chlorophyll = 267 750 + 64 500 = 332 250 MHU 
 
To calculate the energy in something all you need is the chemical analysis and then you can figure the average 
energy.  Now in looking at the making of energy, the two ways of making elementary energy are by working:  
 anions against anions, or 
 cations against cations. 
 
but compound energy comes from working cations against anions. 
 
For instance with ELEMENTARY ENERGY, you can have two anions with a different ratio of Milhouse units, put 
those two particles together and they will seek a new, combined, energy lev el, and as they seek their new level the 
energy that is given off is the lost energy between the variables, the variables being the substances that you started 
with in the first place.  The same thing is true of cations and cations, in other words you may have a substance that's 
just barely a cation, and then you may have one that's extremely cationic and this exaggerated cation then will find 
its level when the two are put together until it will be somewhere between the lower and the higher amount.  
 
For instance, if you take 2 substances with a different pH and put them together they're going to synchronize or level 
off, e.g., combine a very dilute vinegar and a very strong vinegar and the pH will level off to one level.  See cations 
against cations, anions  against anions or anions against cations are the measure of resistance and you must account 
for the loss of energy by the union of the two substances.  For instance if you take sulfuric acid and water and put it 
together it heats up, so the heat that goes off is anionic energy lost, not cationic energy, it is anionic energy, it doesn't 
lose cationic energy. 
 
For example, you may have an anion with an energy of x and another one with an energy of 5x.  The levelling point 
would be a 3x.  This would be your energy level: 
 
For elementary energy: 
Upper energy minus lower energy is  5x - x = 4x   is the difference. 
Divide the difference by 2 4x / 2 = 2x 
 
The result is either: 
 the lower energy plus half the difference is x + 2x = 3x , or 
 the upper energy less half the difference is 5x - 2x = 3x 
 
Another example, with using cations we may have one cation with a 10y and another with a 24y.  The levelling point 
would be 17y. 
 
Following the same principle as above: 
Upper energy minus lower energy is  24y - 10y = 14y  is the difference. 
Divide the difference by 2   14y / 2 = 7y 
 
The result is either: 
 the lower energy plus half the difference is 10y + 7y = 17y , or 
 the upper energy less half the difference is 24y - 7y = 17y 
 
So this is one way energy is made, is an exchan ge in the loss between the two.  Now this is mathematically correct 
but it isn't biologically, chemically correct because there'd be some loss.  You'd have a loss of energy, so it would be 
3x (minus), and 17y (minus), because when we know the substance we can figure the loss, but as we do not know 
the substance then we just call them minus. 
 
Elementary energy is energy derived from an anion with an anion or a cation with a cation, but COMPOUND 
ENERGY is derived from an anion against a cation.  In other word s they're opposite ions and the energy created is 
more because the battle, the resistance, is much greater.  When we put anions together or cations together to figure 
energy it comes out about the same but compound energy, cations and anions reacting toget her is where we get the 
most energy.

============================================================

 
 
Let's put the cations against anions, we'll say we have 1000 cations with an average energy of 750 MHU and 100 
anions with an average energy of 250 MHU so that: 
 1000 Cations x 750 = 750, 000 
 100 Anions x 250 =   25, 000 
 
(750, 000 / 25, 000) x 100 = 3000 
 
The 3000 is the loss of energy in MHU.  You'd lose 3000 MHU in this problem so that about 3% would be the 
maximum amount of energy possible to get from any one substance.  What we're figuring here is the loss of energy, 
not in the remaining substance but i t's the energy lost when the anions come to the cations.  We're figuring the loss 
of energy.  
 
The food that actually becomes a part of you is from the loss of energy between the cationic food and anionic gastric 
juice.  The energy you live from is the amount of energy lost from the undigested food that passes on out through the 
colon as a stool is the potential. 
 
Now let's suppose that a person eats 2 kilograms of food a day, 2000 grams.  3% of this 2000 grams equals 60 
grams, so in a day your potential energy that you would take in would be the equivalent to 60 grams. 
 
Remember this, YOU DO NOT LIVE OFF OF THE FOODS YOU EAT, YOU LIVE OFF OF THE ENERGY 
CREATED BY THE FOODS YOU EAT BY THE RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE ANIONS AND ANIONS, 
CATIONS AND CATIONS OR ANION S AND CATIONS.  So we take calciums and other vitamins and minerals 
not to replace any mineral in our system whatever, we take them for the purpose of creating energy on our frequency 
that the liver puts together to manufacture the part that will fit our own frequency. 
 
Also the energy that you get from your food has much to do with the colour of your skin.  Many times when you're 
lacking in energy your skin will naturally become darker and darker and darker or even become deep tan or 
brownish colour, like yellow because nature is trying to help you to get more energy out of the air and out of the sun 
by making you a darker colour.  Now if you happen to be of an extremely light complexion it means that the body 
could very easily not be assimilating enough Vi tamin D and the body would be too acid, consequently you would be 
a candidate for any bug or malady that come along. 
 
Here's another example in molecular form rather than atomic form in order to help you understand.  Suppose we had 
two substances "X" and "Y". 
 
The calcium in Substance "X" = 33 000 MHU       (1/3)              (Approximately). 
The calcium in Substance "Y" = 66 000 MHU       (2/3)              (Approximately). 
 
Now you add these two together and then you got 
 
 "X" + "Y" = 100 000 MHU                                     Total          (Approximately)  
 
Now you've got two substances here, "X" would be 1/3 and "Y" would be 2/3.  Now the level off point doesn't work 
out with an equal ratio, it works out with: 
 
33 000 / 2 = 17 000  Divide your 33 000 by 2 and you've got, roughly 17 000. 
66 000 / 2 = 33 000 Divide your 66 000 by 2 and you've got roughly 33, 000. 
 
33 000 + 17 000 = 50 000 Would be your theoretical, which would be incorrect. 
 
Half the Total MHU minus the smallest "half factor" would be 
 
50000 -  17000   =    33 000  MHU 
 
Divide by the number of half factors, in this case 4, two each from 33 000 and 66 000.  
 
33 000 / 4 = 8 250 
 
66 000 / 4 = 17, 000

============================================================
PAGE 79
============================================================

 
 
50 000  - 8 000, 
 
Your loss would be approximately 8, 250 say 9 000, so your levelling o ff energy would be about 41 000 MHU 
because of the loss. 
 
In other words in the joining of these two substances together the heat resistance would escape and leave you with 
approximately half the value of your lower value number after it's divided by two.  Your heat loss would be half of 
17 000. 
 
You could also say just take a quarter of the smaller number.  Now suppose instead of being 33 and 66 they were 
more equal then the loss would be less.  Remember, the greater the imbalance the more the loss.  
 
There's a key to energy here, take an anion with a 300 MHU and let it collide with a cation of 600 MHU.  The result 
would be 300 MHU Anions because a Cation has 500 MHU or more and an anion has less than 500 MHU so it 
converts back over to an anion when you lost those Milhouse Units and then that made it an anion. 
 
Let's take another example, take a 100 MHU Anion and let it collide with a 900 MHU cation.  The result would be 
an 800 power cation.  When these two meet they'd seek their own level and you'd have heat.  To resolve this we 
don't add the two together and divide by 2 because they're unequal with power, they're unequally yolked together so 
what happens?  You'll lose 100 MHU from the cation, and what is it that determines the breaking point?  Well, 
you're bombarding the cation with anions and it's just like going against a wall, you could rub against it all day long 
and wouldn't dent it at all, in other words, the greater force does not give up for the lesser force but the lesser force 
destroys itself.  The loss in energy is due to the heat that escapes in the union. 
 
Now pH is only a measure of resistance between: 
 anions and anions, 
 cations and cations, and 
 anions and cations 
 
as compared with the hydrogen ion.  Remember that and keep it in mind, the pH is only a measure of resistance, it is 
not a volumetric reading, it's a measure of resistance, so unless you can keep that fact in your mind you can be led 
astray very easily. 
 
Magnetism 
 
Most people were taught that "opposites attract" but that's wrong, o pposites repel each other.  They do not attract, 
they repel.  The only reason that you've been taught that opposites attract is because of the "bar" magnet.  The strong 
cation "south" picks up cations, leaving the opposite pole to north.  You've been taugh t the name of it wrong in order 
to expound a theory that's false.  If you consider the "Where" and the "What" are the poles of the earth and what is 
magnetism?  Magnetism is the attraction of cations to cations or the attraction of anions to anions and it is the 
combination of Boyle's Law and Baer's Law that says, "like things attract", but when trying to relate a bar magnet 
with the spherical earth there is a problem.  The earth is basically cationic, and the north and south poles of the earth 
are also cationic, or positive.  The negative part of the earth, the anionic part, is the hot centre.  When a bar magnet is 
suspended over the earth the poles must line up north to south because the positive cationic attraction of the magnet 
is greater than any anionic attraction. 
 
In addition to the centre of the earth being anionic, the Van Allen radiation belt above the earth is also anionic.  
Remember, the electrons in an anion travel clockwise as you face the clock.  The Van Allen Belt is about 60 to 80 
miles thick and encircles the earth about 100 miles up.  If you were out in space looking down at the earth the anions 
in the Van Allen Belt would be travelling clockwise and these anions go around with such rapid speed until they 
form a solid shell. 
 
Another example of that, if you take a yardstick and tie a ball of yarn on the end of it, soak it with oil, light it in the 
night and spin it around slowly you can see the person that's spinning it.  Spin it fast enough and it appears as though 
you've got a solid sheet of flame such that you can't see the person that's inside that flame so to speak.  The speed 
with which those anions are travelling in the Van Allen Belt makes a solid shell completely around the earth in the 
same manner that the electrons make a shell around a molecule.

In considering the cations, if you put iron filings on the positive pole of a magnet they will achieve an energy level 
somewhere between their initial energy and the energy of the magnet, and the energy levels will eventually become 
equal.  In other words, the magnet will take on cations and the particle that it's attracted to will also take on cations.  
So they become attracted one to another, and that is the process of synchronization.  But if you want to charge a 
magnet you add cation particles to it and it'll recharge it because then the particles as they seek the level of the 
magnet will also pick up the cations in the atmosphere.  Atmospheric cations are also continually coming in and 
joining it and charging the magnet such that when you're finished you've got more than you started with.  This is also 
the process of how food is taken from the air into our bodies. 
 
The cationic earth turning does not create the electricity in the north and south pole.  The very fact that the Van 
Allen Belt goes around the earth means you have a south positive pole and a north positive pole within the same 
sphere.  Now this can happen within the sphere but it can't within a rod. 
 
It's the magnetic attraction between the anionic Van Allen Belt and the cat ionic earth that also causes the earth to 
turn and as it turns there is a force of electrical energy moving over the crust of the earth from the south magnetic 
pole to the north magnetic pole, and if this force was not in effect then the earth would not tu rn.  It's the same 
principle of the electric drill or any other motor that turns by electricity, there is a force between your armature and 
your fields.  Now during an electrical storm when you get up on a mountain and the static electricity is so great ti ll 
your hair will stand up on the end, or you can pass a piece of plastic over your arm and the hair will stand up on the 
end.  The magnetic anions in the plastic are greater than those in your body and therefore you can feel it pass over, 
and if you will jerk a piece of plastic real quickly in the dark you will see the cations that's in the air strike the anions 
from the loss of the plastic and it'll give you a flash. 
 
The earth is basically cationic and the Van Allen Belt is anionic and this is absolutely  true and when a cationic 
substance gets into an anionic fog it becomes as a flaming torch because there's resistance, and that's why the 
cationic paint is burnt off the rockets as they go through the anionic Van Allen Belt, and the scientists had to find a 
substance to use as a shield that could spread those anions out far enough for the returning capsule to slide through 
behind it before the anions could come in and burn the capsule.  It's almost like diving into the water, if you dived 
into a lake of iro n it'd be your end because there's too much resistance, but in diving into water the water gives and 
let's your body go in and your body pushes the water away from it and this allows your body to go through, and then 
you dive and then come back up again, it's the same principle. 
 
Anions only attract anions and cations only attract cations.  All the cation and anion MHU on Earth are trying to get 
back together again. 
 
Why does a vine crawl along on the ground until it finds a tree to climb counterclockwise?  Why does a tree stand 
up?  Why do you walk with your head up instead of walking down on all fours like a dog?  There's a biological law 
that determines all these things and that biological law is the law of POLARITY.  Anions attract anions and cations 
only attract cations.  Recall the anionic Van Allen Belt that circles above the earth, and all the anions on Earth are 
climbing up, or pushing up and that let's us know which way up is, it lets a tree know which way up is, it lets a vine 
know which way up is. 
 
Now the anions in the earth are coming out of the earth, rising to the attraction provided by the Van Allen Belt and at 
the same time the cations in the air are falling to the attraction provided by the earth.  As the anions rise and cations 
fall each interferes with the other, in other words, there's a battle going on in the atmosphere between the mixture of 
anions and cations caused by the combinations of the winds, air currents and temperatures that causes chaotic 
confusion.  The interference of anions  and cations is the atmosphere and without it there wouldn't be any 
atmosphere. 
 
In the atmosphere the anions are trying to get up to the anionic Van Allen Belt, and the cations are trying to get back 
to the cationic Earth.  Now they're not trying to stop each other but they do get in each other's way and it's in that 
interfering interaction that there is a change in frequency that causes compounds to be formed, water to be formed, 
rocks to be formed and minerals to be formed.  In summary, the interaction o f the cations and anions forms a 
frequency and this follows the rules and laws of physics that are cause and effect.  
 
Now it's the attraction between anions and anions and cations and cations is why some things go up and some things 
go down.  Anions are attracted up to the Anionic Van Allen Belt and Cations are attracted to the Earth.  
 
When you see the flame of a fire, the flame itself is an anionic substance and it goes up.  Now you see smoke 
coming out of the fire and going up yet smoke is composed of car bon and carbon is cationic.  Now the smoke rises

into the air because carbon is a spongy substance and if enough anions get connected to it they'll lift it like hydrogen 
lifts a balloon.  These are basic phenomena, the principles that you must understand i n order to understand the theory 
of energy and you must understand the theory of energy or you will not understand this.  
 
Light 
 
Anions are the very smallest particles of energy and there's also great spaces between them.  Now anions are also a 
teeny bit l onger than they are wide and they roll out like little barrels, they roll out in singles, one at a time, not in 
groups and not in masses, but one at a time.  Now they're generated so fast and they're red hot and they also roll very 
slowly until they strike  something and then they bounce and go long ways.  For instance they roll out like a barrel 
rolling till they strike something and then they go long ways in a straight line, maybe right through you and me and 
half of us in the class here and right through the wall and right on out into space to the Van Allen Belt. 
 
Now, if you get beyond the Van Allen Belt it's dark up there so when the sun sends a beam of light down here it 
strikes the Van Allen Belt and then it starts rolling sideways and lights the Earth  until the earth turns around and 
shades the Van Allen Belt then it is night, is the darkness.  This is what light is.  Remember anions are a little bit 
longer than they are wide and the beam that's sent out from a broadcasting station to your television o r radio set 
through the night, or through a storm or even through solid walls, has anions travelling lengthwise, like a pencil, 
because they're harnessed.  These anions come in waves and they go into your radio and make music or into your 
television set which turns them around and rolls them sideways across the screen and the reflection of light on them 
gives them colour.  Light is anionic beams. 
 
If you had 10, 000 television sets lined up in a straight line, they'll all be picking up the same picture beca use there's 
enough anions to keep all of the television sets in the country running, that's how many there are.  These numbers are 
so fantastically large you cannot comprehend them. 
 
Now there's as much room for an anion to go through a 4 meter thick solid  wall as there is for you to walk through a 
hanger door of a very large aircraft hanger.  Let's suppose that there's a submarine down on the ocean floor 8 
kilometers deep, and 1000 kilometers away there's a broadcasting station, or a ship, sending a messag e.  That anionic 
beam can pass right through the water in a straight line down to that submarine's antenna and never get wet.  
 
There's plenty of room for the anions to pass right through the holes in the water to get down into that submarine and 
so the sta tion or another ship can talk with the submarine at the bottom of the ocean even with a station miles and 
miles away.  This is how small anions are.  Compared to the size of an anion water has holes in it between the 
molecules, like marbles in a tub or lik e grapefruit in a box.  You know you can put a lot of cumquats in a box of 
grapefruit.  It's the same way with anions passing through water.  It's the same principle.  
 
Alcohol 
 
Now the body burns fats by converting them to carbohydrate, that is, fats to sugar and the pancreas converts sugar to 
alcohol and the alcohol makes heat in the body by the action of the frequency of the particles rubbing together 
creating anions of heat by friction.  Now the temperature of collective anions is 980 deg Celsius and t he thing that 
keeps the anions from burning a hole in you is that there is enough space in the cationic matrix for them to get out 
without burning a hole, for instance, a man smoking a cigarette walking through a double garage door does not burn 
a hole bec ause he has plenty of room to get out.  In other words, alcohol creates a high amount of friction and the 
friction kicks off the anions and they have plenty of room to pass out of the body.  
 
The pancreas manufactures alcohol to keep the body warm and if it 's making too much alcohol you are too hot all 
the time.  Now to reduce the amount of alcohol in the body drink some Brazilian Tea that's made from coffee and 
also, in those cases the coffee often makes them sick at their stomach, and that's exactly what y ou want to happen 
and praise God it is because it's trying to change their body chemistry.  If they won't take coffee because they don't 
like the taste of it then shame on anybody that tells you that, just tell them to make out their last will and testimon y.  
People that drink a lot of alcohol get cirrhosis of the liver because it destroys the calcium in the liver.  Remember, 
alcohol is the greatest enemy calcium ever had.   
 
One interesting thing about alcohol is that you can take a bottle full of water, a nd it doesn't matter what the size is, 
and then add 8% more in alcohol and still not run it over because there's plenty of room for the alcohol to get in 
between the atoms of water in there, there's that much space. 
  
Electricity

============================================================

 
 
The forces that we're tal king about is the part of you that makes the difference between a dead body and a living 
body and everyone of us lives on 110 volts of electricity. 
 
A dead body does not carry any electrical charge, only a living body does.  Before a body's stiff, if you p ut an 
electrical charge to the head of a corpse the toes will wiggle and if you put an electrical charge on the toes the hands 
will stand straight up, not from the head, but they'll point upward toward the ceiling.  If the corpse is sitting up the 
hands'll point straight up but if it's laying down it'll point up toward the ceiling, the anions are starting moving 
upward, remember, like attracts like. 
 
The man that made the first volt meter didn't know that we live on 110 volts of electricity that so he start ed it at zero, 
actually the volt meter is 110 volts too low, because 110 on that meter is 220.  For instance in the USA, if you catch 
hold of either of the two wires that provide power to the light and if you're not grounded, because if you're grounded 
then the ground that you're standing on is 110 volts, but if you can catch hold of either wire when you're not 
grounded you won't feel a thing because you're at 110 volts and it's 110 volts.  It's 110 volts coming in and 110 volts 
returning.  It's 110 volts a nionic coming in, and 110 volts cationic returning, in other words, the anions stack up out 
here until each one becomes a power of 500 MHU to return, if it didn't do that it could not return.  
 
When you look at that light globe it is the conflict that takes  place in an oxygenless, hydrogenless chamber that 
makes light possible without an explosion, in other words, inside of that glass bubble there's no oxygen or no 
hydrogen, it's a vacuum, otherwise it burns for so many hours without the wire giving up enoug h electrons until it 
snaps.  In other words, actual pieces of that wire are heated and rolling out anions, which is light, and that energy in 
there is copper energy because it comes from a copper dynamo and these are copper particles.  
 
If the gastric juice  is just the right strength it creates electrical energy and heat energy.  The heat passes right out of 
our body in anionic form but the electrical energy that's created from the food we eat forms the AURA of electrical 
impulses around our body and that can be picked up by instruments. 
 
The United States army had detectors which were able to see the aura and tell whether an enemy was encroaching on 
them.  The detectors picked up the electrical aura of bodies and permitted the soldiers to aim a weapon at the  enemy, 
but they didn't know whether it was male or female, friendly or enemy and it got the troops into a lot of trouble 
because they killed innocent people at night when they were prowling around, so they had to stop the use of it in 
Vietnam. 
 
Foods 
 
All the foods that we eat are cationic, and the liver manufactures a substance called bile that's an anionic substance, 
and remember this rule, the pH of the saliva equals that of the liver bile.  That's pretty close to constant and most of 
the time absolute. 
 
I want to break your first "food fad" right here.  Remember this, all foods are cationic with the exception of fresh 
squeezed lemon juice and water (known as lemonade).  Lemonade appears to be the only food in nature that is 
anionic.  Carey Reams tested ov er 1/4 million different species and over 16,000 different kinds of things that people 
could eat and he found only one anionic food, and that's lemonade, all the rest are cationic.  The electrons rotate 
clockwise in lemons regardless of the variety of lemon.  If it's a lemon it's a lemon and it doesn't matter whether it's a 
Ponderosa, Meyers, Eureka, or any of the other varieties of lemons; they're still anionic substance.  Now regardless 
of all the foods that have been tested it is still possible that ther e's another food somewhere that's anionic that has not 
yet been identified as anionic.  It's all in the direction of rotation of the electrons.  Lemonade is also called natural, 
dilute, hydrochloric acid. 
 
It might also be interesting to know that when Car ey Reams started to can lemon juice in Florida it wouldn't can, it 
spoiled in spite of everything he did but he eventually discovered how to can it, and to can lemon juice it had to be 
made cationic, so he added cationic citric acid to it.  Therefore canne d lemon juice and the ones you find in bottles 
will not work and have the same effect as the fresh lemon juice because it has been allowed to change from an 
anionic form to a cationic form. 
 
Also fresh frozen lemon juice is of no value because it too is ca tionic, and even fresh lemon juice has a certain 
amount of cations and actually there's just barely enough anions to carry it over on the anionic side.  Any processing 
of lemon juice strengthens the cations.

To make lemonade you mix lemon juice with water , 1 part freshly squeezed lemon juice to 9 parts water, and use 
that to strengthen liver function.  You do not use lemon water whenever: 
 you have peptic ulcers and after the lemon gets it clean enough to burn like fire.  When you get the ulcers well 
then you can resume the lemon juice, 
 when it causes the kidneys to swell and becomes very painful, and 
 when there is an allergic reaction and they cannot pass water. 
 
Ion Flow and Plant Roots 
 
In your mind, imagine a plant cutting in a glass of water, and don't turn that glass around and don't change the water.  
On the north side of that plant you'll see little roots come out right in a straight line all the way down.  Now they 
come out on the north side and not the south because the plant has no brain and nature  knows it's way to find its 
food.  The plant finds it's food strictly by the ionization of the magnetic force that travels over the crust of the earth 
from the south magnetic field to the north magnetic field, some 250 miles south west of Cape Town, South Africa, is 
the south magnetic field, to just below the Hudson Bay and the Eastern Standard Time Zone is the North magnetic 
field. 
 
This force travels over the crust of the earth and this is what the rootlets follow in order to find their food, is in the 
direction in which the magnetic force is the greatest.  Actually the plant rootlets are built by ionization and ionization 
is the exact principle by which silver plating, nickel plating, chromium plating or gold plating in tanks takes place.  
This is the way we live is off of those ionic particles of energy. 
 
The next step of this is suppose that we have a vine and we plant it in a pot and we put a stake in that pot.  When you 
look down at the pot all those roots will go around that pot in the same direction which will be clockwise, but where 
the stake is sticking in the ground and that vine starts to climb that stake its gonna climb it counterclockwise. Why is 
it that the roots go in one direction and the vine climbs around the other direction?  Now it's some times said that 
South of the equator they do the opposite but in fact they go around in the same direction as they do North of the 
equator, because the earth turns in the same direction South of the equator as it does North of the equator.  Now 
these are f acts that are positive, but why did the roots go around one way and the vine goes around the stake the 
other? 
 
Actually, if you start at the bottom the rootlet goes the same way all the way up to the top.  If you start at the top it 
goes around the same wa y all the way to the bottom.  Starting in the middle was only to confuse you.  Now this is 
proving the very basic foundation of the theory that I'm telling you, that anions attract anions, cations attract cations 
and anions do not attract cations, they rep el them.  Remember, the Van Allen Radiation Belt encircles the earth and 
is anionic. 
 
Wood Heating 
 
If you look at the light from an oil lamp there are oil particles in the light, or in the fire in a wood stove.  Heat comes 
out of whatever the minerals are that are in that wood so therefore whenever you heat by wood you're more 
comfortable and more cosy than if you have electrical heat, because of the ionization that's in the wood as compared 
to the electric element.  A part of the wood or the electric element actually becomes a part of you.

Abacus.  In studying mathematics you have to know where your loft is.  In our Arabic number system we have 9 as 
our loft.  Some people call "loft" the "base", base 12 or loft 12 for instance.  
 
If you have Base 4, or Loft 4, the "units" would be 1, 2, 3 and 4 is the highest number.  In Base 4 the number 4 
would represent the 10 in our number system.  Then in the "tens" column there would be 11, 12, 13 and 14, then 
comes 21, 22, 23, and 24 and so on.  This is the loft system and is also the abacus system that the C hinese use.

Absentmindedness.  A diet will help absentmindedness if they're not a genius because absentmindedness is a sign 
of genius. 
 
Now if the test does not show tumors there is one specific thing we do, and that is we give them vitamin B3, niacin.  
Start off slowly with 50 mg twice a day between meals and tell them to expect a flush, and when they go 3 days 
without a flush then double the amount they're taking till they reach about 200 mg and then start increasing it by 100 
mg twice a day between meals. 
 
Abuse.  It's not the use of things that's harmful, it's the abuse of things.  Think on it, it's not the use of things that's 
wrong, it's the abuse of things.  For instance, some people say: 
"you've got coffee here?" 
"Sure we have coffee here, what's wrong with coffee?"  Nothing but the abuse of it. 
 
"you've got white sugar here?" 
"What's wrong with white sugar?".  It's the abuse of it is wrong, 1 kg a year is not going to hurt anybody but 
80 kg a year will do harm. 
 
"There's a bottle of wine here, do you drink?" 
"no, I don't drink, but some patients have a bleeding nose that won't stop and we may use the wine for them.  
We get them to slowly sip on about 120 ml of ordinary medium -dry grape wine and it stops the bleeding in a 
matter of 15 minutes." 
 
"You'll see maple syrup and honey here too.  Suppose a person goes into a coma because of low blood sugar 
then we've got to have something quickly to help them".  
 
"you've got foods in here that's got preservatives in them." 
"Sure, I believe that today most foods are safer with the preservatives in than they are without them." 
"Don't you know that preservatives cause cancer?" 
"No I don't know that.  I don't know it at all.  It has never been proved, it's just a fad, it's just somebody's idea 
to write a book, and they wrote a book, and it's very good for the writer, but it doesn't work with people."  
 
Now drugs have never cured anything, but there are times when drugs are needed.  I wouldn't want to have a tooth 
pulled without a pain killer or anaesthetic or som ething of that order.  I'm not against medical drugs, it's only the 
abuse of drugs that I'm against.  Medical drugs are magnificent things when used intelligently and correctly.  It's not 
the use of drugs that's wrong, it's the abuse of drugs.  In the same  manner it's not the use of foods that's wrong, it's 
the abuse of foods and as long as there's hamburger stands and Kentucky Fried Chicken there'll be plenty to do 
because people overdo it.  There's nothing wrong with: 
 MacDonalds Hamburgers, except the abuse of it, 
 Kentucky Fried Chicken, except the abuse of it, 
 the Yoghurt places, except the abuse of it, or 
 the ice cream places except the abuse of it.

Now there's a time for: 
 surgery, 
 drugs, 
 cherry pie, 
 a little wine with your food, 
 coffee, 
 a little bit of Gin 
 
and so forth.  There is a time for most things, but there is no time for cigarettes or tobacco in any shape, form or way.  
I have never known or seen a person that it benefited. 
 
Good health is not a lot of do -do's and no-no's, good health is using the right thing at the right time, for instance, the 
caffeine in coffee is the greatest enemy that alcohol ever had, and if your pancreas is manufacturing too much 
alcohol and you're hot all the time, or have hot flushes during menopause, then a little bit  of Brazilian Tea (coffee 
where you can see the bottom of the cup and not one that'd stand up and dare you to attack it, like molasses), will 
help dilute that alcohol until you'd be more comfortable. 
 
So what I'm trying to say is that there is a time for c offee, but if you've got to have a cup of coffee every morning for 
a crutch then you need more mineral of some kind and you'd better find whatever it is that you need.  Now people 
that drink wine and coffee at the same meal are only throwing nature into co nfusion. 
 
Accident, Automobile.  Low blood sugar is the cause of: 
 motion sickness, 
 about 50% of the automobile accidents, and 
 highway hypnosis. 
 
Acid & Alkaline.   What is the difference between an acid and a base?  Conventional teaching is that a base is a n 
alkaline with a pH over 7.0 and an acid has a pH under 7.0.  That is false teaching, it is not always true.  The real 
difference between acid and base is the direction in which the electrons travel in orbit in the molecule.  The electrons 
travel: 
 Counterclockwise in an acid, which is also a cationic substance, and 
 Clockwise in an alkaline or base, which is an anionic substance. 
 
For this reason hydrochloric acid is not an acid, it's a base, because the electrons travel in a clockwise direction, and 
that has everything in the world to do with digesting your foods. 
 
Now the words "acid" and "alkaline" are really a problem to use because you remember Doc saying in past classes 
that "hydrochloric acid is not really an acid it's a base". 
 
For a highly acid system you can also get the calcium oxide in saline solutions 5  cc, which does a marvellous job for 
neurosis, nervousness, climbing a wall and so forth.  Be aware too that in an acid system the body will store the fat.  
 
With a very low urine or saliva pH that won't shift they may be in an area with a very high aluminium, or very high 
sulfur, and it is quite a job sometimes to get it up, but you should get it up.  In other words, it's a lack of vitamin D.  
At pH 5.20 start giving Vitamin D at 10, 000 units twice  a day and above 5.40 you give 400 units according to their 
weight, 3 or 4 capsules but not over 4 at any one time.  Vitamin D makes the calciums available.  
 
Actions.  Diet has everything to do with: 
 your behaviour, 
 your child's behaviour, 
 how you think, and 
 how you act. 
 
and it goes back to the gastric juice that you have that is manufactured by your liver and stored in your stomach.  
 
Acupuncture.  Now, if you want to know where the transformer glands are you could check the acupuncture points, 
but they're not in the same place on every person.  However there are many more acupuncture points than 284 but a 
lot of transformer glands are on the acupuncture points.  Acupuncture has nothing to do with increasing the reserve 
energy it just makes the transformer glands work a little bit better, a bit more efficiently.

the word Adam means "red mud".  First and last name, Mr. Red Mud. 
 
Addictions & Cravings.  The liver manufactures an enzyme that controls the estrogen and testrogen flow in people, 
and: 
 If it does not manufacture enough estrogen (or testrogen) the person becomes extremely violent, almost 
insane and it can then upset the vitamin B3 and vitamin B5 balance, and 
 If it manufactures the least bit too much of the hormone then they'll have a tendency to get to using too much 
of something and get a craving for it, like too much alcohol, too much coca cola, too much cherry pie, too 
many sweets, too many cigarettes, too much pop, too many potatoes and so on.  Remember this, the least bit 
too much estrogen or testrogen breaks their resistance to things and they're going to get cravings or addictions 
and if the hormone excess increases still a little more then they'll become a vegetable. 
 
It is the level of the sex hormones, estrogen for women or testrogen for men, that is the cause of a person becoming 
addicted to something, or craving something, and you're not going to have a change in Range, or eve n get to Range 
A, unless you take active steps to move the body from say Range B to Range A, because the body will crave the 
foods that keep you in the Range in which you are.  "Like attracts like", and this is Baer's Law and Boyle's Law 
coming into effect in the body so that when your body is in the wrong range you will crave the foods that will keep 
your body in the wrong range, but when your body is in a perfect range you will crave the things that your body 
needs to keep it in that range.  So it's only when you're perfect that you will just know when you need something and 
that's also why when they turn a sick animal loose they'll go and get the mineral and the plant that they need because 
they know what it is, and they've never even had a day in chemistry. 
 
There is a rule that says the body will crave the foods that keep you in the Range in which you are, and it will also 
resist change, but it is the forcing of that change of range, the working against that resistance, that causes the 
unpleasant reactions during withdrawal. 
 
Addictions often start about the time that a person comes into puberty and it may originate in one of two ways like 
this: 
 the soils are deficient in soluble calcium and the foods grown on those soils are also deficient in calcium and  
other minerals like manganese.  When the food is eaten the lack of calcium weakens the digestive juice and 
so manganese is not available to the body. 
 Young teenagers tend to be junk food faddists and this is the time they are coming into young manhood or 
young womanhood.  For women at this time they will start to need 7 times more calcium each day than a 
man. 
 
Regardless of the cause, be it their diet or digestive efficiency, their bodies become deficient in calcium and 
manganese, which then stresses the g onads, and as nature strives to leave offspring and also to compensate for the 
calcium and manganese deficiency, the gonads often initially overproduce on estrogen or testrogen, and it's this 
overproduction which sets the stage for an addiction which may b e to alcohol, cigarettes, white potatoes, cheesels, 
chocolate, drugs, coffee, ordinary foodstuffs, or anything and in this way an addiction is self perpetuating because 
the law of "like attracts like" also means that people will crave the thing they have too much of no matter what. 
 
There was one lady, a doctor's wife, that was absolutely hooked on Irish potatoes, she couldn't live without them and 
had to have them 3 times a day even though she was nearly dead with it.  She just couldn't live without them a nd 
they were killing her, and she'd been through the Mayo Clinic at a cost of $8000, and John Hopkins for $8000 and 
they couldn't help her and she was a walking skeleton.  She even had to have help to walk, and in one week she was 
doing really well because we zeroed in and found out her problem.  She was allergic to Irish potatoes and we'd taken 
her off them, but also told her, "you're going to crave Irish potatoes like an alcoholic craves his drink, and when you 
think you've just got to have them call me up, day or night, and I'll help you. 
 
After six months she wondered what was it about Irish potatoes that she just had to have them.  
 
If the calciums and minerals stay low enough, long enough then after the initial burst of hormone overproduction, 
the gonads' production of estrogen or testrogen then begins to drop off and the person has a deficiency of hormone.  
Now remember, the cause and effect of addiction is: 
 If the system produces too much estrogen or testrogen and the level rises a little bit too high then the person 
begins to become a recluse, or begins to hermitise themself, or to stand apart, and many then begin to get a 
craving for something, or addicted to something or hooked on something.  A little bit too much testrogen or 
estrogen is one of the greatest causes of alcoholism that there is.

============================================================

 
 If the system produces still more hormone then they become a vegetable, they cannot dress themselves or 
feed themselves, they have become absolutely helpless because of too much estrogen or testrogen, and this 
condition is called vegetarianism. 
 
A lack of calcium and a lack of the hormone: 
 causes a woman (estrogen deficiency) to have hysteria, climbing the wall, be nervous, nerves going all to 
pieces and then you put them on the form of calcium they need and immediately there is relief. 
 Estrogen and calcium deficiency can finally be the cause of a woman having a hysterectomy, and 
immediately afterwards she runs into problems of healing, getting well, frustration and many other things that 
the lack calcium does for people that they do not associate with their malady.  A hysterectomy alone will not 
cause a woman to be deficient in estrogen, it has to be the total removal of the ovaries.  In removing an ovary, 
the doctor should not remove the root of the ovary, le ave the root in and it will produce another gland which 
will then produce enough estrogen so that the body will be supplied.  If the root, the embedment of the ovary, 
is removed then it cannot produce any more and they may have to take estrogen for the res t of their life. 
 Testrogen and calcium deficiency causes a man to be more nervous than he should be.  He's afraid, because a 
lack of calcium makes us have lots of fears and a lot of inward insecurity.  
 Testrogen deficiency can cause a man to become dangerous, he can become a criminal. 
 
While we're on the subject of addictions we might as well discuss inebriation, being intoxicated.  The alcoholic starts 
off to drink some alcohol, maybe drink a little whiskey socially then it becomes more and more, more and m ore.  
The first thing that alcohol does is begin to destroy too much of the calcium in the liver and then lack of calcium 
dilutes the gastric juice and then one of the first major elements to be lost is manganese, and then the lack of 
manganese initially c auses the production of the least bit too much testrogen or estrogen and then they become 
addicted to something, because the least bit too much estrogen or testrogen causes an addiction to something, and if 
it's alcohol it's alcohol, or pot, cigarettes, or anything, even potatoes. 
 
Then what happens next is that the food that they put in their stomach is preserved in the alcohol, and it lays in the 
stomach, lays in the stomach, lays in the stomach and they burp and they burp and they burp and then some of t hem 
vomit it up and then they swear they'll never eat food again and they drink to get more energy, and around and 
around and around they go and they're very, very sick people.  
 
The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that alcohol is an illness, and it should be treated as an illness, and 
now when the police pick up people that are inebriated they cannot put them in jail, they have to take them to a 
hospital and the hospitals don't want them. 
 
The right calcium can bring almost instant and miraculous relief. 
 
In looking at addictions and drugs, the effects of marijuana are many and it effects the physical and mental sides.  It 
physically: 
 dulls the mind by keeping oxygen and potassium away from the brain,  
 weakens the liver by keeping oxygen from the liver. 
 
Mentally marijuana actually takes the fight out of someone, makes them yellow so to speak.  They're so at peace 
that: 
 they don't want to do this and they don't want to do that, 
 they don't want to fight, 
 it tends to make a vegetable out of them. 
 
If taken over a long enough period of time it causes: 
 impotence in men.  It causes the testicles to produce too much testrogen and moves them towards 
vegetarianism. 
 loss of libido in women.  It causes a malfunctioning of the ovaries that produce estrogen  and actually it causes 
the ovaries to produce too much estrogen and therefore moves them towards vegetarianism.  
 
It also breaks the resistance so people can't say "no" and they get hooked on something, it causes addictions.  
 
In looking at addictions you'l l come across people that say, "I'm addicted to nicotine", or, "I'm addicted to 
cigarettes".  Now nicotine tar does effect the throat, and under certain conditions it effects the lungs but the news is 
that tobacco is not habit forming.  The nicotine is not  habit forming either.  It's the opium in the paper that's habit 
forming and they even put the opium in other tobacco products like:

============================================================

 
 cigars, and 
 the pipe tobacco that comes in the cans, 
 
and that's the reason that cigars and pipes stink now.  They used to smell good a long time ago, especially on a cold 
morning you could enjoy the odor of somebody else smoking a cigar, but today it's the abomination of abominations.  
Now in order to make t he cigarette possibly palatable at all they even soak the tobacco in sugar to give it a 
marshmallow odor so that people can stand it. 
 
Now whenever you get enough calciums in the system, along with iron and iodine, the first thing that it does is 
rebuild t he 284 tastebuds on the tongue, and the tobacco and nicotine tar will taste so bad till you can't stand it 
anymore and most people will quit smoking when they go on this program.  Even those that have failed on all other 
systems and they couldn't quit. 
 
However, when some of them get to the place that they're scared they're gonna quit smoking they quit the program 
and consequently they hang onto their habit, their cigarette or their tobacco.  I mean anywhere you get it you're 
drugged.  So if you've got to h ave your drug then you're a drug addict, period.  All cigarette people that's hooked on 
cigarettes are drug addicts period, and the quicker they admit it the better off they are.  
 
But if they'll follow this program the taste buds will come alive on the ton gue and you cannot stand the taste of the 
tobacco anymore. 
 
Address.  Did you know that your address is Planet Earth in the Solar System in the great Milky Way.  
 
Adhesions.  When you begin to study carcinoma you're going to be into adhesions in advanced st ages and you're 
going to find all of it a mineral deficiency.  A swelling of the tissue is what actually occurs and takes place whenever 
disease sets in and causes a loss of energy. 
 
Adrenals.  The most needed mineral for the adrenal glands, besides calciu m, is phosphate.  Take care of those two 
and you won't have to worry about the rest. 
 
A woman had her adrenal glands removed and was on cortisone for 35 months and it was hurting her bones and she 
didn't have any energy.  The doctors also gave her 4 days o f heavy doses of salt injections.  Now she told me she has 
Addison's Disease.  Her ankles and the top of her feet are swelling, she's had a kidney stone operation and her tongue 
is dry and grey.  In this case send her to the retreat because there's a whole lot of things that need to be done. 
 
Actually cortisone doesn't always have any effect on the adrenaline glands, it may or it may not, but if it does then 
you shouldn't take it because it's actually doing you damage in order to get the adrenaline glands t o flow. 
 
The primary purpose of the adrenaline glands is the "fight or fligh"t response.  To prepare you to either fight or to 
run and it's got nothing to do with who's the biggest, or who's the littlest, but it's the calciums in your system that 
determines it.  So evidently David had a lot of calcium when he slew Goliath but some people have just a normal 
amount but they got more nerve than they got sense.  If you've got plenty of calciums you'll face the situation.  Now 
the animal that may be most deficie nt in adrenaline is a bunny rabbit.  For instance dinosaurs fought and they're no 
longer in existence and the rabbit ran and he's still here.  Sometimes it's better to be a living coward than a dead hero, 
or so the rabbit reasons. 
 
Adult, Biological.   Anyone 10 years old and older is an adult in the biological realm of nutrition, as far as their 
mineral intake is concerned. 
 
Aeroplane Workings .  We can use pancreatic alcohol as motor fuel in an internal combustion engine and even 
though it's much slower bur ning it does produce a more even power.  Now here's a problem.  In an old -fashioned 
aeroplane, not jets, we have up front the infernal combustion engine.  Now, the engine's job is to have a shaft inside 
which it turns and the shaft is then attached to this  little wing out in front, called a propeller, which it spins and a 
propeller is nothing more than an airfoil. 
 
Looking inside, the way the engine produces power is that there's a hole drilled in a big block of metal and in it 
there's something called a pi ston.  We introduce fuel, say alcohol, gasoline or aviation fuel, in through the intake 
valve, we shut the intake valve, the piston comes up and squeezes the charge, which is a combination of fuel and air, 
and it squeezes it real tight and then we light a match right here, matter of fact, in an airplane if everything's working

============================================================

 
right we light two of them, and kaboom, away she goes and we're on what's called the power stroke, and heat is 
developed, the gases expand which drive the piston down. 
 
Now there is a  layer of oxygen around the Earth and you can relate it to a pile of marshmallows that go way up to 
maybe a hundred or two hundred miles depending on how things are going that day on the Earth, and down near the 
surface the marshmallows are squeezed togeth er tight, which in flying, or anything, we talk about as air density.  If 
you get up to 18, 000 feet, which is very close to the 500 millibar level, you have already run through half of the 
pressure.  You see at the surface air pressure is very close to 14 .7 lb per square inch, I don't know what our elevation 
is here but if you hold your hand out you'd be very close to holding up 14.7 lb of air going right up this column 
through the roof and at the top of the atmosphere on each square inch of your hand.  Yo u can't feel it because it's 
pressing on the underside too.  It's sort of like holding your hand in a bucket of water, you don't feel all the water 
that's up above you.  Enough people have done deep sea diving and know they can feel that pressure on the bo dy 
when they go down about a hundred and ninety feet they'll feel it. 
 
Now back to the infernal combustion engine, the production of the power at the time of the explosion depended upon 
the amount of available oxygen that went into that cylinder for combus tion for the production of heat.  The higher 
the altitude the more an airplane begins to fall off on the job.  If you can get 55% of the available power that engine 
could turn out at sea level you'd be lucky, so we have a way of souping it up. 
 
What we do at higher altitudes is we put a pump outside the intake which grabs hold of this thinner air in the 
atmosphere, grabs it up rapidly, jams it into the cylinder in about the same quantity as you would be able to take it 
without jamming it into the cylinder a t sea level, this way the engine can turn out the same amount of power, or heat 
energy (it's a heat pump) as what it would do at sea level. 
 
Now it's time for you to think, and those that are familiar with turbo chargers be quiet, here is a pump, it has a 
windmill on each end of a shaft so that when one turns the other one's turning right with it.  One windmill is on the 
exhaust side and one on the intake side.  Out of the internal combustion engine comes exhaust and we run that 
exhaust over a windmill to m ake it spin and then that spins the other one on the intake side which is out to the 
atmosphere at very high altitudes or at sea level, makes no difference because we can control the amount of pressure 
it's going to build up, getting the thin air pulling i t in here, spinning it very rapidly and pumping it back into the 
intake system which is going to feed on top of that piston, so that the piston thinks it's still at sea level.  That engine 
will produce as much power at 24, 000 feet perhaps as it does at sea level in an unboosted engine. 
 
How can that engine produce as much power through this method when you are taking hot exhaust gases and 
running it over these blades and then also using it as a power source to drive that air pump without producing less 
horse power than what you would have to start with?  It looks like a perpetual motion machine doesn't it?  It looks 
like all you have to do is spin the blades faster and you make more power, but you're getting the power from the 
engine to spin it so therefore how can it make more power if you're using itself to turn the thing?  The combustion of 
oxygen and fuel produces heat, which goes out as exhaust with all it's heat to drive the turbo and when heat was 
given up, power or energy was delivered. 
 
You see how an airplane relates to the Biological Theory of Ionization in an analogous way.  It seemingly looks like 
something's coming from nowhere and yet it's there, but in the Biological Theory some things are coming from some 
place else and we don't provide it.  Doc Reams says in his Ag Course that if we would provide 20% of the raw 
materials to do agriculture, God produces and supplies the other 80%.  In an experiment he did with putting a seed in 
a closed container and then feeding it water and carefully weighin g the amount of water that he gave it, the amount 
of nutrient that he gave it, the amount of dirt that was there when he got all done after a set period of time he took 
everything away, he shook the dirt off the plant, weighed it, weighed the dirt, weighed  the pot, and added up the 
water it didn't equal what he had to start with, he had more. 
 
Ageing.  Every cell in your body should be exchanged every 6 months, and if it takes longer than that you're 
growing old too fast.  The longer it takes nature to build a cell the more rapidly you are growing old because old 
cells bring about premature ageing.  Pr emature ageing is that something has gone wrong with the system wherein 
nature cannot assimilate, or take, or use the mineral content that's in your food.  
 
You've heard it said, "Every cell should be exchanged every 7 years", well when that proverb was mad e over a 
hundred years ago the average length of life was 39 years for women and 35 years for men, but now it's almost twice 
that, almost.  But every cell in your body should be exchanged every 6 months, and that is one of the ways of staying 
young because the process of ageing is the cell staying in the body too long.

Energy at 20 years old is measured by how much time it takes nature to make one cell:  
 in the heart, 
 in the brain, 
 in the feet, 
 in the toenails, or 
 in the bones, etc.. 
 
and it's the energy from the mineral, divided by time.  That's the explanation, and the formula for how long it takes 
nature to build a cell is: 
 at 20 years old it's X amount of energy divided by time, is an energy rating of 100,  
 at 40 years old it's 2X amount of energy divided by time, 
 at 60 years old it's 3X amount of energy divided by time, and 
 at 80 years old it's 4X amount of energy divided by time. 
 
And this is the process of ageing, is how much energy it takes to make one cell.  The longer it takes nature to build a 
cell the more rapidly you are growing old, it brings about premature ageing.  Premature ageing is that something has 
gone wrong with the system wherein nature cannot assimilate, or take, or use the mineral content that's in your food.  
 
Of course you can work it out in 1/10's between 20 and 40 and 60 and 80.  Just because someone's 80 doesn't mean 
they use 4X.  Doc has seen people: 
 at 40 years old that were using 4X amount of energy and looked and acted old,  
 at 40 that were using 1.5X energy and looked and acted young, and 
 at 80 that were using 2X divided by time and they were quite young, 
 
and this is the process of staying young, is how much time it takes nature to build one perfect alpha cell.  In other 
words, the process of ageing can be slowed down and you can do much to slow it down.  People grow old and die 
too quickly because the time it takes to restore the energy is too long, and the light can't wait for it and it gives out.  
 
Remember, a perfectly healthy baby chicken couldn't grow unless it changed eve ry cell in its body every two days.  
Now those exchange cells are carcinoma cells and in people, if carcinoma cells stay in long enough they may turn to 
cancer.  In other words, they may lose so much energy until they are a decayed cell.  Cancer is only a state of decay, 
premature ageing even at 100, even at 150, premature. 
 
There's only one cause of death and that's old age and it doesn't matter whether it's a baby half an hour old, an hour 
old or two hours old, or a young person at 20, or a senior citizen  at 150 years old, they all die of old age, and old age 
is a mineral deficiency.  In other words, nature cannot take in enough mineral to continue the energy production that 
sustains life, and consequently they don't have enough energy to keep them alive.  
 
It's cause and effect.  Time doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, but it does have something to do with it 
because we're in the oxygenian age of time. 
 
Also one of the processes of ageing is a lack of vitamin A, and practically all senior citizens over 60 need some 
algavim to help make vitamin A available, and it does a fabulous job.  Carrot juice is rich in vitamin A but you don't 
give carrot juice to anyone that is on insulin, diabinese, orinate or diabinate because it is high in sugars.  
 
Agricultural Course.  The agricultural course teaches you to evaluate vegetables: 
 why they have high sugar and why they don't, 
 how to get them with high sugar and how to get them not, 
 the difference in organic ratios, 
 the difference in economy, whether it 's a backyard garden or whether it's a 30 million acre farm it doesn't 
make any difference the principle is the same. 
 how to determine the value of your fertilisers, the organics against inorganics and so forth.  
 
Does anybody else want to know anything abo ut this, you know how to solve the problem on diet and minerals 
without me telling you and you know the rules, but let me show you briefly a little bit about this Agricultural Course.  
I'll give you two problems for comparison and this has everything to do with energy. 
 
A very simple, common equation of a fertiliser is a 4, 8, 8 fertiliser, and this is 40% organic, and let's assume we can 
get this delivered, but not applied, to the farm for $200 per ton.  In a whole ton there is only 400 lb of plant food, i f 
the plants got it all, and 1600 lb would be filler.  So for 400 lb of actual fertiliser you are paying 5 times 200 is 1 ton, 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================
PAGE 91
============================================================

 
which is $1000 per ton that you're paying for usable plant food.  Now this is an all synthetic 4, 8, 8 up here and yet 
it's 40% o rganic which means that 40% of the nitrogen is derived from some substance that's got carbon in it, like 
urea, uremon, urgreen and so forth.  It doesn't have any natural organic in it at all, just a substance that they've added 
carbon to. 
 
Now let's take a  2, 2, 2 100% organic fertiliser, and we can get that delivered to the farm for $100 a ton.  Now here 
you've got 4, 8, 8, and you have to multiply that by 5, but over here we're going to multiply this by 4 and so we have 
an 8, 8, 8.  Now with the 4, 8, 8 w e have 400 lb of plant food and with the 8, 8, 8 we've got 480 lb of plant food.  
Now also an all organic fertiliser will result in a 400% increase when it's applied to the soil but the fertiliser 
company and the State Law will not let you take credit for it because it's not in the bag.  An all organic fertiliser is 
100% available plant food.   
 
Now if we multiply this by 4 in order to know that we got 8, 8, 8 and 20 times 24 is 480 lb.  Now 1 unit equals 1% 
of a ton so you got 80 lb of nitrogen and you got 160 lb of phosphoric acid and you got 160 lb of potassium. 
 
Now one ton of organic on an acre isn't going to be enough because it's not as highly ionized as the salt that is in this 
other non organic mixture so we're going to multiply this then by 5 because we multiplied that other one by 5.  Now 
we've got $500 for 5 tons and now notice what you've got, here you've got 10, 000 lb of available plant food f or 
$500 and here you've got 1 ton of plant food for $1,000.  This is what you're going to learn in the agricultural course 
and it applies to whether it's a backyard garden or not.   
 
In the all organic 2, 2, 2 fertiliser there is 480 lb of water soluble material and then that increases by 400% because 
of the all organic nature of it.  This is the amount that's water soluble but the rest is plant food too although that isn't 
water soluble.  Up here with the inorganic this part is the water soluble part but  there isn't any other kind because the 
rest is sodium or sand or dolomite which will release your nitrogens, then you'll have to buy more.  Anyway if you 
want to take the agricultural course this is not it, I'm just showing you about it.  
 
The 480 is 8, 16 , 24 times 20, in other words this is how much is water soluble and that is ruled by law.  The plants 
can't read the fertiliser tags and they don't know anything about it so they use it all, but there is nothing else to use 
here except what it tells you.  Now let me tell you something else, rain will wash this inorganic one away whereas it 
won't wash this organic one away except for a little bit of erosion.  Now if you have an acre in which you have 5 
tons of fertiliser that will fill an acre of this nature  with 1000 lb, or $1000 or you had 10, 000 lb of plant food instead 
of 1000 lb how much greater would your yield be with 10, 000 lb of plant food than it would be with 2, 000 lb?  It'd 
be 21/2 times and that's a rule you have to memorize. 
 
All of you shoul d take the agricultural course if you really want to master this.  It helps you to understand and 
evaluate foods, and what foods do what and how and why.  And whenever you begin to test foods how to know 
whether they're organically grown or not.  There's s o many things that you do in evaluating foods because there's a 
lot of foods that are grown organically that do not meet the standard that most people expect of organic foods.  
 
Air Food Supply.   Another aspect of digestion in "gas form" refers to where mos t of our food comes from.  20% 
comes from the food we take in and 80% comes from the air and Doc wants to make sure you understand light 
factors, electricity and the music of the spheres.  We obtain 80% of our food energy from the air, in other words, you 
are limited to getting 20% from your food that you eat.  You cannot get any more than that 20% so the rest that you 
get will be from the air.  Let me also say this, although you get 80% from the air you may not necessarily get all of 
the various kinds of m ineral you need, but you will get 80% of your total from the air because only 20% can come 
from your digestive tract. 
 
The main source of minerals in the air is the sea, or bodies of water.  Now when minerals come in contact with salts 
there is a breaking down (corrosion or oxidation) and gas is produced.  Now even in mineral baths some gas is 
produced and that gas goes in through the skin.  Remember, if you painted your body you'd die because the skin is 
meant to be permeable.  When gases go through the sk in they go to the liver via the bloodstream so we are able to 
feed the body through the lungs and the skin as well as through the bowel and this becomes a fantastic source of 
contributing to the up building of the reserve energy, and maintaining reserve en ergy. 
 
Now the air we take in ought to be better down next to the ocean or up under a tree that's putting out oxygen and for 
some people it is, but for some it's not.  For instance, if you've got an inflammatory type of arthritis then most times 
water near the ocean aggravates your condition so badly, and causes the swelling to be so great till you can't stand it.  
As Doc told us, "I had a woman come to me at Orlando from West Palm Beach, and she was in the Real Estate 
business, and she had one of the worst  cases of inflammatory arthritis that I think I've ever seen.  Before she arrived

in town I said, "call me when you get to the hotel that you're going to stay in", and because I wanted her to stay three 
or four days I said, "I'll call you whenever I'm read y for an appointment with you."  Well, the first day I didn't call 
her.  The second day she called me, "Doctor did you forget to call me yesterday?"  
"No, I didn't forget it." 
"Well why didn't you call me, I come here to see you." 
"I know you did honey, but I just can't get to you yet, but I'll call you." 
 
And I waited till the fifth day before I called her and each day she was getting angrier and madder and she was about 
ready to go home when I saw her.  And when she saw me I said, "how is your arthritis?"  And to her great surprise 
there was a great improvement in it, and she hadn't even seen me, and she hadn't noticed that it was going down 
terrifically.  Now what happened? 
 
There were two or three things happening, making her mad caused the adrenaline gla nds to flow but I also wanted to 
know if the ocean air had any effect on it because she lived close to the ocean as it was.  
 
Afterwards, I advised her to move 6 miles from the ocean at least, and she did.  She also did what I told her and she 
got completely well.  But this is what I wanted to know and I told her so then, but I said, "if I'd have told you, you'd 
have thought I was clear off of my rocker." 
She said, "I sure would." 
 
Albumin.  For more information refer to the detailed section on albumin.  Thi s is only abbreviated information for 
the purpose of review.  Albumin is another name for the cellular waste, or debris, in the urine and even includes 
delta and omega cells (carcinoma and cancer cells).  The perfect albumin number is .04 M when all number s are 
perfect and the "M" is short for Million.  Albumin arises from a natural, cellular, base exchange, new cells for old, 
and is the waste cells that are thrown out.  For instance, a carcinoma cell is a cell that is being exchanged, it's the 
base exchange cell before it reaches the stage of cancer or decayed cell. 
 
When you're healthy and drinking the correct amount of water then an adult should throw out 40 000 millilitres, or 
.04 M, of dead cells with each quart of urine, and if you throw out more than that something is seriously wrong.  
Many times the albumin reading is higher than 4M, and I've seen it like soup, but above 4 M it's all counted the 
same, we just quit counting at 4M.  Now the higher the albumin reading the greater dilation of the blood ve ssels in 
the eyes so you see there's a link between the albumin reading with that in the eye.  
 
The albumin at 4M shows that there's a disturbance taking place in the body, and the body is relieving the 
disturbance.  Now when the body is rebuilding there's a lot of base exchange occurring, new cells for old, and the 
delta and omega cells can be thrown out with such extreme rapidity that they can look like pus in the urine, because 
they are still compacted, still together. 
 
In the cell, nitrogen is stored in the cell membrane and the cell protoplasm and when you take the albumin reading 
you are actually analyzing cellular debris, dead cells, which in fact is nitrogen that's still bound up in there.  If your 
system retains the protoplasmic parts of these dead c ells for three days they'll start breaking down into ammonia 
salts, which then build up the toxicity and increase the salt content.  Now a high salt content does many things 
including weakens the smooth muscles and increases the plating effects. 
 
In the eq uation, 1.5  6.40 over 6.40, denotes an energy increase and the purpose in bringing it towards perfect is to 
have a result in the 3 over 3 part, the ureas, and that's cause and effect.  Now when you start a program the albumin 
particles are big at first and then they get smaller and smaller and smaller until they look like little diamonds drifting 
in there when the light shines on them, and you can see those with no problem, but if ever the urea gets up to 20 and 
you can't see those little particles bouncin g in there you're in trouble, I've never seen it happen but I've lived in fear 
to a certain extent that it could happen.  But the person would be so tired and the wrinkles would be back in the 
forehead and it'll be visible.  When you get it as thick as sou p you know it's too high to count, it's out of proportion 
and after 4 million it doesn't make any difference, nature is cooperating and it's all you want to know.  The herb 
Golden Seal is a blood purifier and it works by dilating the capillaries in the kid neys, letting large particles of 
albumin (delta and omega cells) get out into the urinary tract.  Put the specimen in a clear plastic or glass cup or 
beaker and hold it up to the light, or use a penlight, count the particles you see and multiply them by 20  000.  After 
you get to 4 million just quit counting because it doesn't make any difference.

With the debris itself we're dealing in millions, but the main thing you want to know is, "is nature cooperating or 
isn't it cooperating", and this is actually what this reading lets us know.  In some people it may look like there is pure 
blood coming out of the kidneys because there's such a massive breaking down of a cancer because body cancer 
cells are the most red, but kidney cancer cells are a light colour.  For instance, someone who has a 4M reading and 
goes on the program, and if they void a reddish urine within 3 days then it: 
 may be a typical housecleaning situation, or 
 sometimes it could be a kidney stone that turned loose and the irritations breaking up, or  
 it could be ulcers in the bladder, or urethra, or 
 it could be in the prostate gland of a man, or 
 it could be during a woman's menstrual period (it doesn't make any difference whether the woman is 
menstruating or not, you can still do a reading just as well, just don't pay any attention to the red.)  
 
Even though the perfect albumin reading is .04 M, be aware that in a perfect pregnancy with perfect numbers the 
albumin will run about 1M. 
 
Alcohol.  For more information on alcohol see the relevant section under "pancreas". 
 
In Stage II of the development of the cell comes the production of alcohol for heat.   Alcohol is manufactured in the 
pancreas along the line of least resistance from glycogen provided by the liver and one interesting thing about 
alcohol is that you can take a bottle full of water, and it doesn't matter what size bottle, and then add 8% more in 
alcohol and still not run it over because there's plenty of room for the alcohol to get in between the atoms of water in 
there, there's that much space. 
 
The alcohol the pancreas manufactures is similar to 94 Proof Gin and it's purpose is to: 
 keep the body warm, and 
 keep the digestion functioning properly. 
 
It takes one drop of pancreatic alcohol per 100 pounds, or 45 kilograms, of body weight every 30 to 60 minutes 
throughout the day to maintain the proper body temperature. 
 
If there is not enough alcohol produced by the pancreas the body temperature will be somewhat lower than it should 
be, and: 
 they'll complain of being too cold all the time. 
 if they have cold hands and cold feet all the time it' s NOT poor circulation, it's because the pancreas is not 
manufacturing sufficient alcohol to warm their whole body.  Usually you can tell if a person has cold 
hands by when you first meet them, if you shake their hand, or 
 they may have acute indigestion.  You can tell the difference between whether the patient is having a heart 
attack or whether they are having acute indigestion because with acute indigestion you have cold hands 
and cold feet, low alcohol. 
 
If people have spasmodic production of alcohol then they complain of: 
 hot flushes, especially in the earlier part of the day. 
 
If people have too much alcohol in the system they'll complain that: 
 they're too hot, they may have hot extremities, hot feet, hot hands, and so on.  
 alcohol evaporates quicker tha n water, and it also has a heating effect on the inside of the body, and the 
heat inside of the body has an effect upon the alveoli in the lung.  If you've got too much alcohol inside 
your system that little alveoli isn't going to open up, it's going to st ay closed like a ball and moisture's

============================================================

============================================================

 
going to form inside that cavity, and 
 in the morning hours they may have a slight headache, which is a hangover, and that's even from eating 
white potatoes. 
 
Alcohol evaporates quicker than water.  Alcohol heats the inside of the body, and the heat inside of our bodies has an 
effect upon the alveoli in the lung in that if you've got too much alcohol inside your system that little alveoli isn't 
going to open up, it's going to stay closed like a ball and moisture's going to form inside that cavity. 
 
Now the body burns fats by converting them to carbohydrate, that is fats to sugar, and the pancreas converts sugar to 
alcohol and the alcohol makes heat in the body by the action of the frequency of the particles rubbing toge ther, 
creating anions of heat by friction.  Now the pancreas manufactures alcohol to keep the body warm and functioning 
at the right temperature and if it's making too much alcohol you are too hot all the time.  To reduce the amount of 
alcohol in the body drink some Brazilian Tea made from coffee (weak black coffee where you can see the bottom of 
a teacup, and not one like molasses that's strong enough to stand up and dare you to attack it) and in those cases the 
coffee often makes them sick at their stomac h, and that's exactly what you want to happen and praise God it is 
because it's trying to change their body chemistry.  If they won't take coffee because they don't like the taste of it 
then shame on them, and anybody that tells you that.  Just tell them to make out their last will and testimony. 
 
You know good health is not a lot of do -do's and no -no's, good health is using the right thing at the right time, for 
instance, the caffeine in coffee is the greatest enemy that alcohol ever had and if your pancre as is manufacturing too 
much alcohol and you're hot all the time, or have hot flushes during menopause, a little bit of Brazilian Tea will help 
dilute that alcohol until you'd be more comfortable.  
 
What I'm trying to say is there is a time for coffee, but  if you've got to have a cup of coffee every morning for a 
crutch then you need more mineral of some kind and you'd better find whatever it is that you need.  Now people that 
drink wine and drink coffee at the same meal are only throwing nature into confus ion because they act in opposition 
to each other. 
 
People that drink a lot of alcohol get cirrhosis of the liver because it destroys the calcium in the liver.  Remember, 
alcohol in excessive amounts is the greatest enemy calciums ever had, and alcohol dilu tes or destroys the gastric 
juice by the destruction of the calcium in the liver.  In other words, the more calcium that's destroyed in the liver the 
more dilute the gastric juice, and some people's own system will manufacture too much alcohol and this sti ll causes 
their gastric juice to be too dilute.  If you're healthy you don't need to drink alcohol at all and it will make you too 
hot if you do, and if your pancreas is manufacturing too much alcohol and you take in still more in any form, it'll 
make you too hot. 
 
Since the body uses sugar to make alcohol it follows that if the sugar reading is too low, say less than 1.5, AND the 
Saliva pH is low, AND the body temperature is on the cool side then alcohol may need to be added to the diet.  
Alcohol is used for anyone having: 
 indigestion, 
 heartburn, 
 gas, 
 cold hands and cold feet. 
 
Usually people that have a high pH will have gas, cramps, poor circulation, and if you are anaemic you'll have cold 
hands and feet then alcohol may have to be added to aid in the mai ntenance of body temperature and digestion, and 
in fact acute indigestion is related to the lack of pancreatic alcohol. 
 
I'll just explain something to you here and that is in your urine pH when it's up around 7.10 or 7.15, or even a little 
higher at 7.20 but then it would go into another zone, but in Zone B say 7.10 pH and you have a 5.40 saliva pH, or 
even lower pH, then you have an ideal setting for acute indigestion.  Now people don't have acute indigestion 
anymore they have heart attacks because there' s no money in acute indigestion.  They can get acute indigestion well 
in 30 minutes, but it takes 2 weeks for a heart attack in a hospital and you can tell the difference between whether the 
patient is having a heart attack or whether they are having acute  indigestion because with acute indigestion they have 
cold hands and cold feet.  Those are symptoms that let you know it's acute indigestion, cold hands and cold feet.  
 
In the case of acute indigestion or gas the fastest way to get relief and the thing tha t you can do is: 
 give them a teaspoon full of 94 proof gin, Zest Tonic, or half a teaspoon of pure peppermint essence, in 
120 ml (4 oz) of ordinary water, skim milk, grape juice, 7 Up, Coke, or something like that and have them 
sip it, sitting up, slowly f or 30 minutes.  Do not let the patient lay down, be sure they sit up and it's also a

very good idea to pat them gently on the upper part of the back or use a vibrator on the back to help them 
burp, and when they start to burp they will get relief.  Don't b eat them too hard and don't beat them to 
death, just a gentle pat will do very well, like burping the baby.  It's steady like you're beating on a drum 
but it has to shake the body and that'll cause the gas to be released. 
 
Now the cause of indigestion is o nly the gastric juices being too dilute to digest your food for whatever age you may 
be and interference with the regular way the heart beats, or heart skips, can be caused by a whole lot of things, 
including the pancreas not manufacturing enough alcohol to control the body temperature. 
 
For alcohol support, if the weight is 90 lb or over then mix 1 teaspoon full of 94 proof gin in 4 oz of either skim 
milk, grape juice, or whatever you have because you want it diluted down.  Have them sip it slowly for 30 m inutes 
because if they drink it quickly they'll not have accomplished anything, they must drink it slowly and when I say 30 
minutes I don't mean 29 minutes, I mean 30 minutes. 
 
In place of the Zest Tonic or gin, if you can't get it when you need it, you ca n use a naturally fermented medium dry 
wine, it's not as good and is really a very poor substitute. 
 
People with a dark skin absorb more Vitamin D energy from the sun than people with a lighter skin, and the more 
Vitamin D that you absorb the more alcohol your body is apt to make.  One reason why the dark skinned man, the 
Negroid races, can be more relaxed than the white man, is because their systems manufacture more alcohol and they 
may be more sleepy all the time, so relaxed their sleepy.  It's been said the black races are afraid of work, in fact 
they're not afraid of work at all, they can lay down and go to sleep right by it and many times it is the manufacture of 
pancreatic alcohol that causes a lack of initiative, or laziness, so to speak. 
 
While we're on the subject of alcohol we might as well discuss inebriation, being intoxicated.  The alcoholic starts 
off to drink some alcohol, drink a little whiskey socially then it becomes more and more, more and more.  The first 
thing that alcohol does it begins to destroy too much of the calcium in the liver and then lack of calcium dilutes the 
gastric juice and then one of the first major elements to be lost is manganese, and then the lack of manganese 
initially causes the production of the least bit too much te strogen or estrogen and then they become addicted to 
something, because the least too much estrogen or testrogen causes an addiction to something, and if it's alcohol it's 
alcohol, or pot, cigarettes, or anything, even white potatoes "I just cannot let it alone", then what happens next is that 
the food that they put in their stomach is preserved in the alcohol, and it lays in the stomach, lays in the stomach, 
lays in the stomach and they burp and they burp and they burp and then some of them vomit it up and  then they 
swear they'll never eat food again and they drink to get more energy, and around and around and around they go and 
they're very, very sick people.  
 
When you're faced with an alcoholic the first thing in the world to get an alcoholic off of alco hol is to get him to 
want to be delivered, he needs a desire to co-operate and then once you do that then you start giving him calcium and 
it makes it much easier.  The AA is doing a fabulous job except that it's not coordinating diet with their program an d 
when they do it's going to do a much greater job in putting a great more zing behind the AA.  Now the patient's got 
to want to do it and many times they're so nervous because of a lack of calcium available to their system that unless 
the first dose does it, it's no good.  The people need patience and education about how this system works.  
 
The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that alcoholism is an illness and should be treated as an illness, and 
when the police pick up people that are inebriated t hey cannot put them in jail, they have to take them to a hospital 
and the hospitals don't want them. 
 
Alfalfa.  People who have haemophilia, bleeding that you can't stop, whose blood is too thin and therefore bleed too 
freely, should use Vitamin K, which y ou'll find in alfalfa.  The sprouts, tea and tablets are a natural, excellent, rich 
source of Vitamin K and no prescription is required.  Vitamin K causes the blood to coagulate.  
 
Do not use alfalfa with patients who have cancer or advanced carcinoma, beca use the blood has a tendency to be too 
thick already and the Vitamin K in alfalfa only makes it thicker.  By giving them a diet that is high in Vitamin E and 
also the Vitamin E tablets you keep the blood thin enough for the kidneys to pull out the dead cel ls or the carcinoma 
cells and health is regained. 
 
Alkaline & Acid .  A person who is consistently alkaline before breakfast and acid for the rest of the day is very, 
very ill and should be in a retreat.  I would send any person that had that problem to a retreat to find out what the 
cause was because a lot of people are a lot more ill than they think they are.

Alkaline Elements.  Remember this, in all of our foods there's only three alkaline, or anionic, elements:  
 Potassium, 
 Calcium, and 
 Chlorine. 
 
Alkaloids.  All foods have alkaloids in them but it's the sulfur that could do damage and it could only do damage 
whenever the pH gets below 6.0. 
 
Allergy.  Allergies to foods are related to the frequency of the body.  In other words, once you know the frequency 
then you know the diet, just that simple.  Know this also, there's not anything that somebody somewhere is not 
allergic to.  I don't know of anyone who are not allergic to something, and any allergy is caused by a high stress 
food, that's why you have the allergy.  Some people are allergic to canned fish, some are allergic to iced tea, some 
are allergic to Irish potatoes, some are allergic to any kind  and all kind of salt water fish but not fresh water fish, and 
vice versa, and some people are allergic to chicken and it doesn't matter how you fix it they're allergic to it.  Some 
people are allergic to carob and others are allergic to lemons.  Some are allergic to cabbage, some allergic to onions, 
you name it, and somebody's allergic to it.  Remember, go by your numbers, let your numbers determine whether 
something's a high stress food for you or not because what is a high stress food for one may not be for another.  If 
your numbers are going away from perfect it's high stress, if they're coming towards perfect or staying near perfect it 
is not.  Strictly go by your numbers, the way your numbers read, because I do not know any food which isn't a high 
stress food for somebody. 
 
There are two general effects with allergies: 
 Pancreas Effects.  The pancreas produces insulin, alcohol and thyroxine and if the pancreas overflushes 
the temperature can go up and sugars go down, or even the opposite effects, and  
 Kidney Effects.  An allergic reaction causes the kidneys to close down which results in the body retaining 
water causing swelling, swollen ankles, puffed up tissues and so forth. 
 
There are as many allergic effects as there are people, for instance, an allerg y to chaparral effects different people 
differently.  With some people it makes them very hot and they might wake up in the middle of the night just 
burning up in which case take them off of the chaparral and they'd stop burning and there are some people t hat it will 
give them a very severe case of diarrhoea and they can't take it and in others it stops the kidneys from working.  Go 
by the numbers.  Some allergic effects are: 
 Carbohydrate.  Some patients on the lemon juice and water, with sweetener, and the ir sugar reading keeps 
going down and down it indicates that the body has a problem handling one or more carbohydrates that 
they're having and that's generally an allergic reaction to certain specific kinds of carbohydrates, but not 
all kinds.  Find out which one they're allergic to and discontinue that one. 
 Chaparral, which generally stops the kidneys from flowing.  If you're allergic to chaparral use ginseng.  
 Chocolate,  which generally stops the kidneys from working. 
 Honey, which causes the pancreas to over flush.  Occasionally there'll be a high sugar. 
 Lemonade, which means they can't drink it at all and I don't mean a sick stomach or headache or 
vomiting.  The lemonade stops the flow of water through their kidneys.  
 Mango is a very good fruit but an allergy can cause puffed up lips and so on. 
 Milk.  Some people with a milk allergy may have an allergy to goat milk, or cow's milk, or skim cow's 
milk or both.  Most of the people who have an allergic to cow's milk, not all of them, but most of them, 
50% probably, could take goat's milk just fine and they could also take cow's milk if the cream was taken 
off, skim milk.  It's the cream that's disagreeing with them, and probably the casein in the cream more so 
than the milk itself. 
 Onion stops the kidneys from taking the water out of the system. 
 Rice, bread and wheat all effect the sugar reading. 
 White Potato, effects the sugar reading. 
 
There was a family that came for testing one time, father, mother  and seven children, and every one of them was in 
a diabetic zone.  They were told, "all of you are allergic to white potatoes" and the mother almost died with shock, 
she said, "what else is there to eat?  We buy them by the 100 lb, what else is there to eat?"  So I had to tell them what 
else there was to eat. 
 
Once you clean up the liver and sort out the bowel most allergies leave.  Some people will say, "I have an allergy to 
this", or "I have an allergy to that", when they don't have an allergy at all.  The only thing about it is when they take 
it, it starts to ch ange their body chemistry from the wrong range to the right range and they start to go through 
withdrawal and they quit their program.

Now the medical profession considers that a person that has low blood sugar is allergic to all carbohydrates and they 
give high proteins and tell you to discontinue your carbohydrates, but what we do is break all rules and find out why.  
We decrease their protein meats terrifically and put them into a low protein diet, no protein substitutes, or anything 
of that nature and also put them on fruits and things, one at a time, until you find out which fruit or which 
carbohydrates causes the pancreas to flush and then we discontinue that one and it solves the problem.  
 
All Spice.  The all spice for the lungs I was speaking of is made up of a mixture of many, many different spices and 
not just the spice called Alspice. 
 
Aloe Vera Gel.   Aloe Vvera gel is basically recommended to soothe an irritated colon.  If you had haemorrhoidal 
condition or ulcers or something in the digestive tract then Aloe Vera would be a great help to you quickly. 
 
Amino Acid.   See also Enzyme and Vitamin.  An amino acid is a building block of a protein, and it's also any 
molecule that has protein in it.  Now Doc changes these around somewhat but yet they mean  the same thing.  He 
says that anything that contains a protein is an amino acid.  In other words, amino acids themselves are blocks of 
proteins but yet the amino acid building part is protein itself, molecular size, and there are some proteins that are no t 
digestible to us.  In Doc Reams' terminology, amino acid, enzyme and vitamin are one and the same.  Vitamins are 
enzymes, enzymes are amino acids and amino acids are vitamins.  If you think of insulin as an enzyme produced by 
the pancreas, it is an amino  acid.  Why, everything that goes on in your system is related to amino acid, they are the 
electrolytes of the system, and all electrolytes have to do with either catalysing or promoting reaction and they also 
have to have mineral content too.  Even bone h as amino acid cells, in fact, everything in our body has amino acid 
cells. 
 
It takes 18 hours for the liver to build an amino acid, and when it gets lemon water into it, or lemonade, depending 
upon your sugar content, it can use it as a base for forming some 5 billion different enzymes a day with less chemical 
change than any othe r natural substance known to man.  Now with the liver we're talking about it making up to 6 
billion different enzymes or amino acids in a lifetime, but in any one 24 hour period it manufactures about 5 billion, 
if we are perfect health with an energy ratin g according to our age.  The 6 billion includes those specific to infancy, 
babyhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and so forth. 
 
Remember, there are more cells in the brain than in the rest of the body put together, but more importantly, the brain 
is the origin of ionization and the main site for ionization is the liver.    Now the liver never finishes what it starts, it 
only completes the first 60% -80% of the building of the amino acid leaving the remaining 20% -40% to the 
transformer glands.  When finished, or nearly finished, the amino acid goes into the s tructure of the body.  Now, 
when you take lemon juice it is to help your liver to become a more efficient nuclear reactor because it takes about 
18 hours to form an amino acid in the body, and that's one of the reasons why you need that small little shot o f 
lemon juice and water for your liver spread throughout the day.  You get too much and it's going overboard.  
 
Amish.  The Amish people say that our retreats are the place where they get well on stale jokes and lemonade.  So it 
doesn't matter how to get well just so they get well, that's all that counts. 
 
Analysis.  According to Black's Legal Dictionary a diagnosis is a guess limited by experience whereas an analysis is 
something that you perform in a laboratory, and it doesn't matter how many technicians r un the same test they will 
all almost have the exact same answer.  The difference between a diagnosis and an analysis is that an analysis can be 
proven, and the diagnosis may or may not be proven. 
 
If you look at your problem without your numbers you are d iagnosing, but if you've got numbers you're analyzing.  
Go by the numbers and analyse.  In this system if a thousand people learn it and know it well enough like we want 
them to then all will come up with the same problem.  You may find ten thousand ways o r more to solve the 
problem, but the problem you're working on will be the same and your answer to what the problem is will be the 
same. 
 
So this is what counts is accuracy, firmness, and believe in what you're doing.  All who use this system will come up 
with the same answer because it is an analysis based on mathematics.  Now this system is mathematical and if you 
do your math correctly you'll get the right answer, and it's very difficult to do it incorrectly because you'll get off on 
a tangent and you'll find yourself lost in an ocean of numbers. 
 
These tests show: 
 Quantitative analysis, quantity, how much of a substance you've got, and 
Copyright 2012 by Rob Owen 

============================================================

============================================================

 
 Qualitative analysis, quality, the kind of substance you've got. 
 
Quantitative analyses are no more accurate than the te ster, and if you make a certain number of mistakes what will 
happen is that the picture will be too foggy. 
 
Anemia.   Leukemia and anemia are both in the same category, it first starts with an iron or iodine deficiency in the 
liver which is the result of a  calcium deficiency, and there may be an oxygen deficiency from the lungs.  It's a chain 
reaction and consequently the body does not manufacture or accept or receive from the foods enough Vitamin A, and 
the amount of Vitamin A you take has nothing to do wi th the amount that's available to you.  You may be taking it 
by the pound and doing yourself damage, so what you need to do is to find out why the body is not assimilating 
Vitamin A and set the body chemistry in position to accept Vitamin A.  I have not fo und one single case of leukemia 
or anemia where there was a high or low WBC that did not have the lack of Vitamin A. 
 
I had a patient who was so highly anaemic and very much underweight so I told her to take 2 x 250 mg vitamin B12 
tablets twice a day between meals and come back in 2 weeks for a retest.  When the pH gets to be about 5.4 then 
watch for anemia. 
 
Anatomy.  Yo u must remember for every cause there is an effect, for every effect there is a cause, and for every 
place those numbers are on that scale there's a reason for them being there and you must learn why they're there.  
And as you learn why they're there, and you understand enough about anatomy, you can then begin to visualise and 
see the picture that those numbers are trying to present to you.  As soon as you really learn your anatomy you're 
going to find it much easier to understand the course and it will mak e it much easier to understand the relative 
energy stored, absorbed and used by the various organs of the body.  I think what you need to do is to really get 
down and learn your anatomy.  Learn what the inside of you looks like because it's absolutely impo rtant. 
 
Now the relative weight of body tissue in order is: 
 Skin,  
 Bone, then 
 Muscles. 
 
and the body is comprised of hard tissue, or bone, and soft tissue and the division of the total mineral weight is:  
 Bone   - 26% of the total mineral weight, and 
 Soft Tissue  - 74% of the total mineral weight. 
 
Now the more the density of the tissue the faster the electron travels and the darker the colour.  Now if you can think 
for a minute, glass is actually a liquid and you know over a period of years you can measure the thickness of a pane 
of glass at the bottom of the pane with a micrometer and see it getting thicker, while at the middle and top it's getting 
thinner the way gravity effects it, but yet the electrons are moving slower in that window and that's the reas on light 
can pass through easier and less concentrated than they are in say a brick wall.  
 
Are your kidneys made out of the same substance that your brain is made out of?  Or is your brain made out of the 
same substance that your liver's made out of?  Not at all, they are entirely a different substance.  The body distributes 
the elements to the respective part of the body that contains the element that is in question, for instance, the feet have 
more benzene in them than any other part of the body.  Now in anatomy the various organs are different colours and 
it's the mineral composition that makes the difference.  The liver is denser than the heart and is darker.  The heart is 
denser than the brain and is darker.  In other words, the greater the density of m ineral the darker the organ.  If you 
have a liver that's very light then that means you'd have less mineral in it, and lack of mineral is disease, which is the 
cause of cause and effect.  When we talk about minerals we're actually talking about the atomic structure and it's the 
lack or abundance of them that determines health. 
 
Now one of the strange wonders of the body and the world is that you have a cationic liver manufacturing anionic 
substance for digestion and the bowel and out of that anionic hydroch loric bowel comes cationic amino acids that 
become a part of our various organs.  You are cationic substance and therefore what you're made from has to be 
cationic substance.  So learn something about your body, study about your body because you need to kn ow it. 
 
For instance, a dead body does not carry any electrical charge, only a living body does.  Before a body's stiff, if you 
put an electrical charge to the head of a corpse the toes will wiggle and if you put an electrical charge on the toes the 
hands will stand straight up, not from the head, but they'll point upward toward the ceiling.  If the corpse is sitting up 
the hands'll point straight up but if it's laying down it'll point up toward the ceiling, the anions are starting moving 
upward.

The electrical voltage in our bodies, and the voltage that all life lives upon, relatively speaking, is 110 volts and that 
is only in us when we are a living body, and therefore the Spirit of God that leaves us upon death must be a Spirit 
containing 110 volts.   Something leaves us and it is photographable, there's photographs taken of the Spirit leaving 
the body, have you seen any of them? 
 
If you study your body half as much as you study your automobile you'd be a lot healthier and a lot happier.  If you 
think of the body like a car most people just need a minor repair job, a tuneup, just a minor tuneup, that is if they 
come early enough, but if they wait long enough then they may need a major repair job.  
 
So what I'm trying to say is don't expect the numbers to tell you anything, they're just numbers on a sheet of paper, 
but why they're there is very, very important, absolutely important, and you must learn what they mean.  
 
Ancestors.  Sometimes when you find a young fellow come in and he's kinda cocky and smart and if you really want 
to throw him off of the smartalec train say, "I can tell by looking at you that you've got ancestors."  
And immediately he becomes very worried, "how do you know?  What are the  symptoms?", and he wants to know 
all about "ancestors" because he's never heard the word. 
 
It's a word that's seldom used even in high schools today.  Most of the high school students don't even know they 
have ancestors today and one of them thinks something's wrong with one of their teeth. 
 
So, it's very good idea sometimes to get their attention whenever you have them come in.  
 
Angstrom.  Now angstroms represent how far apart the electrons are in orbit in the shell of the mol.  Now for the 
male the electron completes a revolution in an amount of time of 2.4 x 10 -6 seconds which is a very short period of 
time.  (0.0000024 = 2.4 x 10-6). 
 
Doctor Reams and Doctor Black came up with the term 'angstrom per second' while studying this together and trying 
to find a term, and they agreed on "angstrom per second" and the symbol for angstrom is A with a little circle over it 
(D). 
 
When I originally saw it I couldn't figure out what that meant because we got to talking about it and an angstrom is 
10-8 centimetres and if it took a whole second to go that little bit they're moving awful slow you'd hold it in your 
hand.  It's going a very short distance and a second's quite a while. 
 
Just as we had trouble properly defining these terms we also found in the case of the al pha, delta and omega cells 
that there's many times no English word for some of these things, or terms for what we're trying to say or do, and 
we're trying to get the nearest one that we can find in the dictionary to fit what we're trying to explain.  
 
Anion.  See entries under “Ion”. 
 
Antibiotics.  Doc mentioned treatment with antibiotics to fit the body chemistry.  Go by the numbers.  For instance, 
certain people have allergies to penicillin, and many people know it by trial and error, others don't know it.   Go by 
the numbers. 
 
Appreciation.  I am reminded that when I first got married I don't think any man's wife loved him as much as my 
wife loved me, and she really worshipped me, she really did.  She set a burnt offering before me every morning, and 
I didn't want to hurt her feelings and I said, "this is just the way I like my toast" and it was 7 years before she caught 
on that I just didn't want to hurt her feelings.  So anyway there's always a bright side of life you know and you learn 
to appreciate things. 
 
Arizona Salmonella.  In mathematics Arizona Salmonella is a 126 case, and it was discovered in 1898 in Cuba, and 
it is a disease that was mislabelled.  The bacteria at that time that caused typhoid and malaria were in the Salmonella 
group so anybody th at didn't discover a salmonella wasn't any chemist at all, or physicist.  So this thing was found 
and the reason it was called Arizona was the doctor that discovered it was from Arizona, and he called it Salmonella.  
Actually it's not a Salmonella, it's a trichinosis. 
 
Now this can only come from eating pork and some even get it from smoked sausage, or boost meats, or luncheon 
meats because they've added pork to it.  I have never known this to be in any animal other than a pig, and one 
woman said, "I've had this problem for about 2 years and I haven't tasted pork in 15 to 18 years."  Well that bacteria

had gotten in there and slowly got its start and spread and spread and spread.  So your own resistance can slow them 
down or speed them up but I've seen it also strike very  rapidly.  There's no way to tell how long they've been in 
there, but it does come from eating pork. 
 
The bacteria looks like small seedling pecans and it embeds itself in the lining of the digestive tract.  Once lodged 
inside of that lining the individual  bacterium secretes a substance which forms something like a plastic house for 
itself, but it leaves the ends of the plastic house open so the food can come in, seep up and keep it alive.  The effect 
of many millions of them is that they secrete a substanc e which causes the intestinal wall to thicken and become like 
plastic on the inside such that the digestive juices can't go through it, the blood can't go through it, water can't go 
through it and the patient slowly starves to death. 
 
In many cases too it also causes the intestinal villi to shed off and once the villi sheds off then moisture does not go 
on through, it leaks through the lining of the intestines and collects in the abdominal cavity and it has to be drained 
off.  Now 6 to 9 months is a long ti me for anyone to live once it sheds off because it's not been known to rebuild at 
all for anyone. 
 
Now Arizona Salmonella strikes women much more than it does men, but it does strike men too, and the percentage 
of cases seen is about say 5 in 10, 000.  Doc  didn't find a case in anyone under 25 nor did he find it in pregnant 
women, but mostly it strikes people in their 30's and all ages upward is when you really know they've got it and there 
was no age group above 25 that it didn't effect.  He didn't know wh ether they could or couldn't get pregnant, because 
sometimes when something like that happened nature permits a pregnancy, but he never saw it in a case of Arizona 
Salmonella. 
 
Now Arizona Salmonella can strike anywhere in the digestive tract from the tong ue, throat, esophagus, stomach 
lining, small intestine and all the way down to the colon but many times it strikes in the small intestine.  One of the 
first visible signs to your eye is that the tongue will be swelling just a little, however it can kill pe ople and never get 
into and swell the tongue.  Sometimes the tongue can be swollen so badly until it's sticking 4 cm out of the mouth 
and they couldn't even get it in, their face was all bloated, eyes closed, and in terribly bad shape, in fact, dying.  
 
"We were not able to save two patients that came in, one in Haiti choked to death 3 days later because we 
were not able to stop the swelling, and the other one was at Blue Ridge.  We did a few sessions with her in 
the colonic room, and cold and hot compaction  to get her tongue back to normal, and get her to where she 
could be sociable and even walk around, but she died 4 months later.  We were not able to keep the 
energy in her at all, she just kept going down, down, down, we couldn't stop it.  However she wou ld have 
died within 24 to 30 hours if she hadn't have got to us when she did, so we actually didn't do anything but 
prolong her life a little and made the end a little bit more pleasant, but it was too late, she slowly starved 
to death." 
 
It's the same kin d of death that you get from starvation, Beri Beri, and you'll also see these numbers on Beri Beri 
patients, except on a Beri Beri patient you'll see an enlarged or extended stomach, and on a Arizona Salmonella it 
does not swell, there is no fever, the numbers almost stay perfect, and it's a terrible, terrible agonising death.  
 
Now they eat like a horse, they're hungry all the time and eat terrific amounts, and the food doesn't disagree with 
them, but they've really got a problem.  The foods cannot digest e ven though the liver puts enough bile in there to 
digest it because the water keeps it too dilute and it cannot get through the intestinal walls, also the water can't get 
out so it all washes through.  In other words, since the water can't pass through the  bowel wall into the system it all 
goes out through the bowel and causes them to have diarrhoea all the time, a watery bowel.   
 
It might be interesting for you to know that we've had a patient with it for over 6 years and she's still living.  She has 
not recovered at all except that she has not gotten any worse, we seem to have it arrested.  She has not gained any 
weight but then she was not as far advanced as the other patients.  We've had another patient for about 3 years and 
another one for about a year  and we have two now at less than a year, and they're still living and they are not losing 
any more weight, but they have not gained any weight either. 
 
Now when you have a person who is real skinny and underweight it's possibly a 126 case, and it's a good  idea to let 
them eat often.  If you suspect a 126 then always put them on the K -Min, 2 x 3 a day, and you may not be able to 
cause them to gain any weight but you can probably keep them from losing any more weight.  So this is something 
to work towards, and to work with, and to keep in mind, is that K-Min has been able to stop that problem of 126 cold 
turkey in it's tracks now on about 8 cases we've got.
