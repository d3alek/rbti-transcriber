                        I&#x27;d like to welcome all of you to a course that I have not had, so we&#x27;re all going to be together and uh this is a totally new avenue of this continuing series of the biological theory of ionisation. And uh the reason I&#x27;m having this course, he&#x27;s told me enough things, and he&#x27;s taking my grey matter that he told me if I had have a course he&#x27;d finish. So I&#x27;m waiting for the finish and lot of things he&#x27;s told me and uh So we got kind of an outline I&#x27;m going to have typed up here and we&#x27;ll pass out on what he&#x27;s going to kind of cover.

                        And then tonight and tomorrow night I&#x27;ll have about uh an hour and a half, two hours of uh one of the things I want to cover real thoroughly with you is what our on dairy calves, calf problems, scours, health problems and this type thing. I&#x27;m real fortunate in this area I have three thousand payo calves that are shipped in here every winter. And I get a pretty good education.

And so I&#x27;ll be covering some of that and then Dr. Eames will be going into his aspects from the biological theory of ionization which is those of you who&#x27;ve have the soils course, he&#x27;ll be relating that to the how it effects the animal in quite a little detail.

                        And also give you some tips and things that we can do in the interim here. But the one thing I want you to do remember when he&#x27;s lecturing and this type of thing is that Dr. Eames thinks of mathematics and for some of you that may be hard to understand.

                        And when he gets a thought pattern going uh for the benefit of most of us in the room is to try to refrain from your questions until that thought pattern is done because otherwise he gets off that and it&#x27;s hard for him to get back on. specific pattern now we&#x27;re not trying to discourage questions don&#x27;t get me wrong but there is times that it&#x27;s easier from letting finish that and then come back with a question now when a question comes up under that kind of a circumstance it&#x27;d be best if you could write it down and it would help you greatly then we can pick them up at a different time but I think this would be the most helpful from that standpoint when these things do come to mind Now, a few other things uh the uh there will be cassette tapes taped here and we&#x27;ll try to get the questions and the answers as best we can.

I find when I leave over three we forget all of them. But if I just leave you one or two you&#x27;ll remember them and can take them home with you and that is that duty to God or service to God begins where duty ends.

So you must go beyond duty in order to be of value, and it&#x27;s only that part of your life that you go beyond duty that pays high dividends.

                        Also, the person is so busy in the church attending to other people&#x27;s business. Uh, don&#x27;t have very much fruit, and to criticize everybody else&#x27;s. But remember this, as farmers, as men in a community, as a part of our government, it&#x27;s a lot, it takes a lot less energy to push anyone up than it does to push them down.

                        Because when you&#x27;re pushing down they&#x27;re going to resist it and I&#x27;ve never seen a man resist being pushed up Also, it takes twice as much energy to get up after you&#x27;re going down with them as It were to push them up in the first place so Conserve our energy everything we say everything we do depends on energy of some kind Our lives as what we are depends on spiritual energy. Our progress in the farm depends on spiritual energy.
