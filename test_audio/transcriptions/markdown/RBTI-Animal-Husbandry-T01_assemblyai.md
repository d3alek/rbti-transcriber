## Speaker Transcript

### Speaker A

Like to welcome all of you.

### Speaker B

To.

### Speaker A

A course that I have not had. So we're all going to be together. And this is a totally new avenue of this continuing series of the biological theory of ionization. And the reason I'm having, of course, he's told me enough things.

He's taken my gray matter that he told me if I'd have a course, he'd finish. So I'm waiting for the finish, and a lot of things he's told me. And so we got kind of an outline I'm going to have typed up here, and we'll pass out what he's going to kind of COVID And then tonight and tomorrow night, I'll have about an hour and a half to two hours of.1 of the things I want to cover real thoroughly with is what are dairy calves, calf problems, gowers, health problems, and this type of thing.

I'm real fortunate in this area. I have 3,000 pale calves that are shipped in here every winter. And I get a pretty good education how to keep them alive. And you soon find out there's some you cannot keep alive, and I'll tell you why.

And so I'll be covering some of that. And Dr. Eames, he'll be going into his aspects from the biological theory of ionization. Those of you who've had the soils course, he'll be relating that to the. How it affects the animal in quite a little detail.

### Speaker B

And.

### Speaker A

Also give you some tips and things that we can do in the interim here. But the one thing I want you to do and remember when he's lecturing and this type of thing is Dr. Reams thinks of mathematics. And for some of you, that may be hard to understand.

When he gets a thought pattern going. For the benefit of most of us in the room is try to refrain from your question until that thought pattern is done, because otherwise he gets off at it. It's hard for him to get back on a specific pattern.

Now, we're not trying to discourage questions, don't get me wrong. But there is times that it's easier for him to let him finish that and then come back with a question. Now, when a question comes up under that kind of circumstance, it would be best if you could write it down and it would help you greatly.

Then we can pick them up at a different time. But I think this would be the most helpful from that standpoint. When these things do come to mind, a few other things, there will be cassette tapes taped here, and we'll try to get the questions and the Answers as best we can.

I realize that time seems it doesn't always happen, but we'll try to do it. And if you're catching us, we're not doing it often get after us about it because we get going on up here and sometimes we slip up on that.

The tapes that I have, they're a 60 minute tape. I buy the highest quality tape I can buy. They're not cheap tapes and they're $4 apiece from up here. You're welcome to go ahead and record them yourself. I always said in these courses, as long as it doesn't interfere and make a lot of commotion and noise.

Try to use your best discretion, please on that. And on Wednesday night we're going to have a banquet. When Dr. Reams teaches courses, this thing, he likes to have a banquet. So that will be on Wednesday night.

Just come and we'll announce that later. Anyway, there's no charge for that. That'll be in the course here. So with that, Dr. Reams will start and each morning he likes to have a short devotional and then we'll go.

### Speaker C ⏰ 03:12

On Dr. Scowl make a difference scaffold. She's clear now.

### Speaker A

Okay, that's what it is. That's one of them spliced ones in. That's all right. The one mic will work as long.

### Speaker B

As you can hear it on there. There's no impeacher. All right?

### Speaker A

Okay.

### Speaker C

Good morning.

### Speaker B

This morning in our morning devotion, we're going to talk to you about a book. The first thought comes in your mind is the Bible. Well, that's one book, but there's a lot of others. And most of you, most of you fellows were born with television, brought up with it.

When I was born, we didn't have television and we had more time for books and we didn't watch television so much and we had more time to watch the girls.

### Speaker C

So youth is youth at any time.

### Speaker B

Not a lot of difference in a. In our ways, but there is difference in the way we plan our time. And the Bible is a book that limits, that is limited by time. In other words, it really begins with time and ends with time.

But the thoughts in it lead us to a perpetual destiny. Not the book itself, but the thoughts that are in it that we can make a part of ourselves. If every one of us or each one of us was limited by a book, progress would almost cease.

It's only that effort, or only that actually wisdom that you use beyond the knowledge of the book that really counts. If you're just going to be a.

### Speaker C ⏰ 05:39

Teacher Go buy the book. But if you're going to be a progressive farmer, then go beyond the book.

### Speaker B

Along about 1937.

### Speaker C

At 2 o' clock.

### Speaker B

In the morning, I got a call to a poultry farm about 40 miles away. And I went out to this poultry farm and got there about 4 o'.

### Speaker C

Clock.

### Speaker B

And this man had been in the candy business all the days of his.

### Speaker C

Life and he was up in his.

### Speaker B

Early 70s and he had gone into poultry business. And the most up to date standard poultry farm, I guess in the state. He had conveyor belts for feed, conveyor belts for taking out the manures.

### Speaker C

And it was really fabulous poultry army.

### Speaker B

Boilers is what he was going to produce. And he had 75,000 baby chicks come in the same day and 25,000 turkeys. And him brand new, never raised a chicken in his life. And three days later, it was a.

### Speaker C

February morning, the humidity dropped and the.

### Speaker B

Temperature was 85 in the poultry houses and the chicks were dying by the bucketful. And when I got there, there was a pile of baby chicks like you can't believe, and baby turkeys. You had two or three colored men going through picking out the dead ones.

And the chicks were all huddled in one corner making a noise as if they were cold. He had two feed men out there and one man from the university who lived near there, who was supposed to be a specialist in poultry, had been there since about 10 o' clock that night.

The specialist in poultry from the university. When I got out there, they said they had told me that the chicks were poisoning, poisoned on something. And to bring my emergency chip for poisoning. I brought it all right.

But I walked down through the poultry houses from end to end and looked at them.

### Speaker C ⏰ 08:10

And the first question I asked was.

### Speaker B

I couldn't see any thermostats in the building, so where are your thermostats? And there was in the building outside where you could set at one place, set the thermostat in any building. So that took me out to where.

### Speaker C

The thermostats were and I turned each.

### Speaker B

One of them up to 100.

### Speaker C

They said, you're going to cook these chickens.

### Speaker B

I said, you can't eat them raw. There was a case that the humidity had dropped and the chicks were freezing.

### Speaker C

To death at 85 degrees.

### Speaker B

And in two hours I said, well, aren't you going to test the water and the feed? I said, no, you called me out here to fix it, I've already fixed it. And I said, in two hours there won't be any more chicks dying.

And there were Not. He said, well, there's nothing in the book about that. I said, if they had, you wouldn't have called me. But I'll guarantee you this, it'll be tomorrow. It'll be in the book tomorrow. So this is what I'm telling you.

### Speaker C

Go beyond the book.

### Speaker B

Dare to go beyond the book. Use that head. There's a knot on everybody's shoulder here, and in it there's supposed to be.

### Speaker C

Some brains, and use them.

### Speaker B

Go beyond the book. Don't try to be limited by the book unless you're a professor, and then present more than one way of doing a thing. When I was in college, you only presented one way to do it. I've spent 50 years in research, and I found as many ways to.

### Speaker C

Prosperity.

### Speaker B

And also to this poorhouse. Go.

### Speaker C

By.

### Speaker B

Your problems.

### Speaker C

In other words.

### Speaker B

You don't need a book to have a problem. And then you need to refresh your memory on what has been done on or about that problem. And if none of the things that's been done on that problem, then do the next best thing.

And that then is beginning to solve your problem, is to go beyond the book.

### Speaker C ⏰ 10:29

Now, where do you start when you.

### Speaker B

Go beyond the book? And that is to see everything you look at. You know, most people go through life and they see very little. In the agricultural class, I asked the class how many people knew which way the seed in a watermelon pointed to the rind or to the heart.

And, you know, most. I think there's only two or three in the class. And you, they don't see everything you look at. Pay close attention to everything you see, register it in your mind, and then you can begin to collect points in solving your problem.

But one thing I advise you never to do is never to take your problems to bed with you. Unless she's a female. Don't take your farm problems to bed with you. Your domestic problem. Yes. So.

### Speaker C

This week we're going to learn.

### Speaker B

Things that are not in the book. And you're going to also learn that.

### Speaker C

The books are for one purpose, and.

### Speaker B

That is to get you to thinking.

### Speaker C

Now, if you were in a mechanical school, then you would go buy the book.

### Speaker B

But you're not dealing with a mechanical object. You are dealing with a biological life where there isn't any real pattern of perfection as far as putting or taking apart the parts like an automobile.

### Speaker C

There's no car keys, there's no nuts.

### Speaker B

Except the one that's trying to solve the problem. He can be a part of the answer instead of a part of the.

### Speaker C ⏰ 12:36

Problem, the farmer of tomorrow and the.

### Speaker B

Minister of the gospel of tomorrow that is most successful is going to be the one that does their own thinking, collects their own prejudices and sets a precedent for themselves and keeps their mouths shut about how they made their progress. Because you will find the thing that.

### Speaker C

Worked for you does not work for your neighbor. Always.

### Speaker B

Sometimes he does. Once in a while, down in Georgia, there was Jed. A friend called up his friend Jed and said, jed said, when your mule was sick, what did you do for him? Jed said, I gave him a quart of turpentine.

So Jed met him on the street on Saturday night. Rob said, how's your mule? He said, that quarter turpentine killed him. Jet said, it killed my viewer too. So sometimes with your remedies, you need to find out what the result is before you apply the remedy.

So what I'm trying to say is let's put some horse sense behind our farming, behind our practices, behind our religion and works.

### Speaker C

Now, in regard to our morning devotion.

### Speaker B

This morning I want to leave you one main thought. I find when I leave over three, you forget all of them.

### Speaker C

But if I just leave you one or two, you remember them and can.

### Speaker B

Take them home with you. And that is that. Duty to God or service to God begins where duty ends. Service to God begins where duty ends. Don't forget that. Because as long as you're doing your duty, that's not service for God.

So you must go beyond duty in order to be of value. And it's only that part of your life that you go beyond. Duty that pays high dividends, and I tell you how high it will pay. Then your paycheck becomes, or your net profit becomes God's report card.

### Speaker C ⏰ 15:24

When we're in school, we work for a grade. But when we're in life, we work for remuneration of some kind.

### Speaker B

But then your paycheck is God's report card.

### Speaker C

How well pleased he is with you. I'm going to give you a verse of Scripture.

### Speaker B

Now for my second thought in the scripture this morning. This one you will find in Amos, the book of Amos, the third chapter.

### Speaker C

And seventh verse.

### Speaker B

In the King James Version. It says, I will not. The Lord is speaking to Amos, and he said this. I will not do anything except that which I will reveal to my prophets. Some of the translations are italics, if they ask me, which it is understood without the italics.

So one of the things to do in farming, when all biological life is depending upon God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, communication with you is to ask him what you don't know the answer to. That's where I got my answers.

And I don't have them all.

### Speaker C

I just have a few of them that works. And we're going to learn about those.

### Speaker B

Answers or some of those things this week.

### Speaker C

But go beyond the book.

### Speaker B

Even in your spiritual life, go beyond the book. Go to the point that when Jesus said, my sheep know my voice, go until you hear his voice. In order to hear his voice, you're going to have to turn off the television for a few hours on the radio or the hum of the tractor.

You're going to have to listen. And there's no time better in life to listen than in the night when you are awake.

### Speaker C ⏰ 17:33

And the more awake you are at night, the healthier you are.

### Speaker B

You don't need the rest. No one has ever died from lack of sleep. But the cemetery is full of people who died from worrying about it. When you're ill and sick, or if you're dead tired at night, if you're dead tired at night, you're sick.

But if you got a lot of energy in the evening, your reserve energy is higher. So take care of your health and then you can think straight. Sick people can't think straight. So then also you're going to find it's the same thing in biological life that keeps you thinking straight as well as theological life.

You've got to be able to have the right foods to think straight.

### Speaker C

I believe there. I believe that the farmers of tomorrow.

### Speaker B

Can be our nation's finest doctors. And that many of them will be if they produce a high quality food and they know what they have and.

### Speaker C

They know how to market it. And that's what we're going to study.

### Speaker B

About this week is how to have a higher quality food at lower cost per package and get a premium price in the market. I'll give you an example. Right now in Boston we are paying up to 50 cents apiece for a little grapefruit.

And the farmer in Florida is getting.

### Speaker C

A dollar for two bushels, a hundred grapefruit.

### Speaker B

Just think of that. Just think of it. Well, there's a lot of. There's too much loss between the farmer and the retail market. Now a year ago in Boston about over the United States, we were paying $7, well, $7.50 to $8 at this time of year, end of January, for lemons.

We're paying $22.50 now for the same box of lemons, not because they had.

### Speaker C ⏰ 20:03

A short crop, but because a lot.

### Speaker B

Of People are drinking lemonade. A lot of people become more in demand and there are going to be more demand. So supply and demand is what causes.

### Speaker C

Prices to go up.

### Speaker B

But also remember this, that the market has never been flooded with top quality produce. There is always a great demand for top quality produce. And you know, the church has never been flooded with real saints of God.

Real saints of God whose faith, whose.

### Speaker C

Faith.

### Speaker B

Is backed up by works. Faith without works is dead. And by their fruits ye shall know them. A saint of God is a peculiar person in that it is impossible to insult one.

### Speaker C

They are insult proof. They are so busy attending to God's.

### Speaker B

Business until they don't have time to attend to the neighbor's business. And consequently they have a good report.

### Speaker C

Card and have a good paycheck.

### Speaker B

Also.

### Speaker C

The person that's so busy in.

### Speaker B

The churches tending to other people's business don't have very much fruit and they criticize everybody else's. But remember this, as farmers, as men in a community, as a part of our government, it takes a lot less energy to push anyone up than it does to push them down.

### Speaker C ⏰ 22:04

Because when you push them down, they're.

### Speaker B

Going to resist it. And I've never seen a man resist being pushed up. Also, it takes twice as much energy to get up after you've gone down with them as it would to push.

### Speaker C

Them up in the first place.

### Speaker B

So let's conserve our energy.

### Speaker C

Everything we say, everything we do depends.

### Speaker B

On energy of some kind. Our lives as what we are depends on spiritual energy. Our progress in the farm depends on spiritual energy.

### Speaker C

The crop grows on life given from God.

### Speaker B

You can't put life in a seed. You can't put life in a hill of grass. You can't put life in a hill of corn. But God can. So start giving him the credit and believe me, he'll give you the cash. Isn't that a fair exchange? This is my morning devotion to you this morning.

I'm going to ask that you think much upon it, take it home with you what you can, and use it.

### Speaker C

For the glory of God.

### Speaker B

Father, we thank you this morning for this time and this morning devotion. We thank you for the opportunity of.

### Speaker C

Coming before these and share the wisdom.

### Speaker B

That you have given to us.

### Speaker C

There are many new thoughts, many new ways, many new ideas, as much progress.

### Speaker B

At hand that has not been used. And may each of us go home a little better prepared to handle the problems that you have given us to strengthen our faith than we find ourselves.

### Speaker C ⏰ 24:07

When we first come here.

### Speaker B

Answer this prayer, dear Father and We.

### Speaker C

Will give you the praise throughout eternity. Open our minds today as have never been opened.

### Speaker B

And touch us by Thy Holy Spirit, Father, as we've never been touched. And teach us how dependent we are.

### Speaker C

Upon Thee, and we'll thank you forever and ever perpetually.

### Speaker B

Amen.

### Speaker C

So how many of you are attending.

### Speaker B

This class that I have taught or Dr. Stowers taught.

### Speaker C

For the first time? One that either one of us has never taught.

### Speaker B

How many of you are new in this class?

### Speaker C

Hold up your hands.

### Speaker B

Okay. There's quite a few.

### Speaker C

For the old.

### Speaker B

Ones here has had some of the teaching.

### Speaker C

I want to give a very few minutes review.

### Speaker B

Energy.

### Speaker C

Everything that moves, moves on energy.

### Speaker B

And when I went to college, an.

### Speaker C

Atom was thought to be the smallest.

### Speaker B

Thing that there was because that is the smallest division of an element. An atom is the smallest way that an atom can be divided. But the thought came to me, if an atom was the smallest thing that there is, why aren't all atoms alike? Why is one silver? Why is one gold? Why is one carbon? Why is one hydrogen? Why is one nitrogen? And all this was questioned in my mind also when I was a boy from 6 to 12 years old.

### Speaker C

My nickname was Question Box.

### Speaker B ⏰ 26:10

And most people did not know my.

### Speaker C

Given name other than Question Box, because.

### Speaker B

I wanted to know the answer to so many things. I'll give you an example.

### Speaker C

I wanted to know if we ate.

### Speaker B

Chicken, why we didn't grow feathers on us, and if we ate beef, why we didn't have horns and a tail. And nobody could answer my question.

### Speaker C

I mean, this thing was really a perplexing question to me.

### Speaker B

It wasn't that I was trying to be silly or foolish.

### Speaker C

I really wanted to know the answer and thousands of other questions.

### Speaker B

I was an eternal killer asking questions. And one question I asked was, when you sell out sweet potatoes, why do.

### Speaker C

You cut them early in the morning.

### Speaker B

Throw them out in the sun all day and let the vines wilt, and then stick them in the ground late in the afternoon? Why don't you set them out whenever they're fresh and tender? Well, when I got to be a man, I set them out. When they were fresh and tender.

You know what happened? They all rotted off at the ground. So I had to throw them out and let them wilt. But nobody could answer my question. The only answer I got, well, that's the way my daddy did it. And that's the way his daddy did it.

And that's the way his daddy did it. And, you know, most farmers today are about 40 years behind in Progressive scientific practices. We have not turned loose the old, we did not dare to try the new. And we expect these things to just turn out in luck.

And today, if you take the gamble.

### Speaker C

Out of farmers, most farmers would quit.

### Speaker B

They love the gamble of it more than they really love the progressive accuracy of it. Well, we can be a lot more accurate. Now, back to the atom. Well, there had to be a difference somewhere. But I was taught that in an.

### Speaker C ⏰ 28:10

Atom there was the same number of protons as neutrons.

### Speaker B

Well, I was also taught in college by the university that negatives attract positives, the opposites attract each other. But yet there was Bayer's law, there.

### Speaker C

Was Bond's law, there was Fermi's law.

### Speaker B

All saying that, like, things attract each other, which was the conclusion of these laws. One dealing with solids, one dealing with gases, and one dealing with solids and gases. All of them ended with a conclusion that light things attract each other.

Well, if light things attracted each other, how is it that opposites attract each other?

### Speaker C

Well.

### Speaker B

I didn't find the answer, but I wasn't satisfied. So in my research, I came up.

### Speaker C

With these facts, and they can be.

### Speaker B

Proven that there is not the same number of protons as neutrons. Because if you did, everything would have the same specific gravity and everything would revert back to the line of least resistance or the ratio of one to one in dehydrogen.

That's just common sense. As a fourth grader could think that one out. Now, I did learn to find out why atoms are made up of anions and cations. But how many and how much? Well, an anion is the smallest thing.

### Speaker C

That God ever made, and it's singular.

### Speaker B

And they're always in their singular, they're.

### Speaker C

Never in their plural.

### Speaker B

And they're so small, you cannot cut one in two. You cannot divide it, you cannot take it apart. It comes as a whole. Yet recall one anion to 499 anions. An anion we still consider regardless of the number.

Consider it an anion. Now, it's like putting a container here.

### Speaker C ⏰ 30:22

With marbles in it. You don't take the marbles apart, but.

### Speaker B

You can take out some other marbles. Now, one marble would represent one Milhouse unit of energy.

### Speaker C

One marble would represent.

### Speaker B

Limits of the power of an anion is from 1 to 499 milhouse units of energy. A single cation contains 500 mil house units of energy. It's just a little bit bigger marble. In other words, at the same temperature and pressure, it would be 500 times larger than A single anion would be the size of one cation.

The cation Milhouse units of energy are from 500 to 999 Milhouse units of energy.

### Speaker C

You're going to need this when you.

### Speaker B

Get into the feed this week. Feeding of animals and the growth of animals. Going to need this information. We're just going to let you peep through the keyhole at it this week, though.

### Speaker C

And if you need to know more.

### Speaker B

About it and have not taken the agriculture course, then come and get that.

### Speaker C

Because the.

### Speaker B

Progress of the farm begins in the field, not in the barn. Also, let's call 1 mill house unit. Whether it has 500 mil house units or 999, it's still considered 1 milhouse unit. And discussing it there again, you just.

### Speaker C

Got a bigger marble.

### Speaker B

You can't divide the marbles, so. But you can divide the strength of your milhouse units, but you're not dividing any single milhouse units unit, whether it is a cationic or anionic. Now, the anionic is the negative or the alkali, and the cationic is the positive.

Also, the anionic is the negative.

### Speaker C ⏰ 32:49

And.

### Speaker B

The cationic is the positive, carries the positive. So in this. In this we will find the secret of the atom. Now, an atom, you have two kinds of atoms. You have the negative and the positive atoms.

### Speaker C

And some of the things I'm going.

### Speaker B

To tell you here in the class is going to be exactly opposite from what you've learned in college. Well, all I say is, don't believe a word I say.

### Speaker C

Go prove me wrong. Go out and prove me wrong. Because I have already worked with it.

### Speaker B

50 years in a laboratory, and I find that it works whether I understand it or not. And this is the way I explain what appears to me to be the truth. For instance, an atom, hydrogen, has one negative and one positive or one anion and one cation in its singular form and its smallest existence of an atom of hydrogen one to one.

So that is why we compare all ph readings to hydrogen, because it's the simple atom, it's the simplest form. So we compare our ph ratios to hydrogen atom. A carbon atom is always positive. The anions are on the inside and the cations are the electrons on the outside.

Also, in a positive substance, the electron travels counterclockwise when you're looking directly at the spectrum of the atom. And a negative or an anionic travels clockwise. And that's the way energy is created by the resistance.

Now, here's the key. Between the resistance between Anions and cations with different Milhouse units of power versus cations with different mill house units of power versus anions and cations. So there you have the three forces and three ways by which all energy is made.

Now, what's so important about that? When you go feed it, are you going to feed a cow or a horse or a chicken or yourself or your family? Well, that is the principle. That is the biological law by which life exists.

Mr. Einstein taught us how to move.

### Speaker C ⏰ 35:49

An object from A to B in.

### Speaker B

The same direction or from A back.

### Speaker C

To A if you go far enough.

### Speaker B

But he did not teach us how to move it from B back to A regardless of the distance. So in the biological realm and in the silver plating, nickel plating, chromium plating realm, it can be done. Otherwise your atoms become actually unharnessed and completed.

But in this other realm.

### Speaker C

In the.

### Speaker B

Realm of E equals MC squared, there's only a loss of energy. But in the other two forms that we give, in the class of agriculture, you have a gain of energy, collective energy. If that wasn't true, nothing would grow.

There would be no sizes.

### Speaker C

Everything would be.

### Speaker B

Well, actually, there wouldn't be any life upon this planet.

### Speaker C

There's one more thought I want to.

### Speaker B

Bring to you in this regard, and that is the colloidal elements, the colloidal elements. There's two kinds of colloids. One kind of colloid is a measurement of size measured in millionths of microns. The other one is a measure of a compound that each mouth contains all elements within that compound and cannot be taken apart.

There always were just so many of.

### Speaker C

Them and no more.

### Speaker B

That cannot be created or made only by God himself. In the beginning, about 3% of our bone is a colloidal substance, and that is what makes our teeth and our bones. And also the fiber of plants is largely made up or mineralized by colloidal particles.

Remember, here's another law of physics that.

### Speaker C ⏰ 38:06

I'm going to give you, and don't you forget it.

### Speaker B

Don't forget it. 80% of all the food for animals and plants comes from the air. They only get 20% through the mouth.

### Speaker C

Of what they eat.

### Speaker B

80% comes from the air. We're going to go into that more a little later in the class, but remember that 80%. So therefore we can conclude that we do not live off the food we eat. We live off of the energy from.

### Speaker C

The food we eat.

### Speaker B

Now back to the colloid. The colloid in nature is what the jewel is to the watch. It's 100% available. It does not have to be digested as such. It is never a part of the soul of the plant or the person or the animal.

It is a part of the energy that can be lost and therefore taken up to be used by another plant.

### Speaker C

Or animal or person.

### Speaker B

So these are factors that you're going.

### Speaker C

To need to know. Now.

### Speaker B

Another factor that bothered me as a.

### Speaker C

Boy.

### Speaker B

Began when I was five years old. A minister, circuit rider minister, who came around once a month, preached on the resurrection of the dead.

### Speaker C

But he went home with my parents.

### Speaker B

That day, and.

### Speaker C

While we were having dinner.

### Speaker B

I said to him, I don't believe what you said today, preacher. My father and mother's face all clouded up. I knew I'd said something wrong with just being a little boy. I didn't know what it was. He said, what did I say that you did not understand? I said, well, you said that when people die, they go to the grave.

And when Jesus comes, he's going to open the graves and take them to heaven with them. And don't you know when people die or when things die, they go to dust and you can't put them together again. You say, well, you're just a child now, but when you're a man, you'll understand these things.

Well, I didn't understand them. The martyrs burned at the stake, the.

### Speaker C ⏰ 40:34

People buried at sea, eaten by the.

### Speaker B

Fishes and scattered all over the earth. It became almost an impossibility to me. I did not understand it. It was a massive confusion of impossibility. My problem was I was trying to bring God down to my size.

But in 1934, a couple of police officers brought into my laboratory some ashes from a building that was burned and said, can you tell us whether this was an animal or a person that was burned in this building? The undertaker had been a lifelong friend of my father, about my father's age. He had a crematory, and I borrowed ashes from him and I determined the.

But people live on frequencies, and I determine the frequency. And in those ashes there were not one person. There was three people because their frequency was the same. But there was three different micronages.

And the metamicronids denoted that there were black people. And when I gave this report to the police department, they said there was a woman, colored woman. I was in colored town. This building burned, and her son and daughter were missing.

I could not tell anything about the age, but my description was close enough that it became a closed case of that. So I learned the frequency upon which people live. And I was already doing research upon plants on the frequency they live and animals on the frequency they live.

And Dr. Northrup of Germany taught me.

### Speaker C

The frequency of grapes.

### Speaker B

But he didn't exactly explain all to me in his broken German that I didn't very well understand all the details of his experiment, but he did teach.

### Speaker C ⏰ 42:42

Me the frequency of grapes.

### Speaker B

Now, once you know the frequency, then you know the diet. That's just a matter of mathematical calculation. And also the frequency of cattle. Just take cattle, deer, buffalo, moose, elk is all the same. They're all on the same frequency.

But all varieties of sheep is on a different one. And goats another.

### Speaker C

All variety of hogs, regardless of what.

### Speaker B

You might call them, are on the same frequency. Whether they're wild or tame, it doesn't make any difference. But the micronids determines the species that separates the species. But in human beings, we don't think of species, but yet we think of differences.

And the millimicronage determines the color.

### Speaker C

The metamicronage is the path of the.

### Speaker B

Electron in orbit that determines the color because of the prism of light. Now, all this has a lot to do with feeding an animal. You know that anything with a yellow color to it has more vitamin A in it than other things it doesn't have, like carrots.

Yellow corn has more vitamin A in it than white corn. But white corn and the same soil, generally, if there's enough calcium in the soil, will have more carbohydrate in it. So that's why people grow white corn.

### Speaker C

To eat and yellow corn to feed their animals.

### Speaker B

Also yellow corn, the grains shrink up.

### Speaker C

A little bit more.

### Speaker B

It doesn't carry the high carbon content. Therefore, the volume will weigh a pound or two more per bushel, but yet be more deficient in mineral in that bushel than the bushel of yellow corn. Now, that's the only exception, just about that.

I know when there can be a small deficiency in mineral and an increase in weight. But most of the time, any increase in weight in carbohydrates means an increase in carbohydrates. An increase in carbohydrate generally means an increase in weight.

### Speaker C ⏰ 45:20

Now, if you bring your yellow corn.

### Speaker B

To the maximum of its carbohydrate and the same percentage, then it will weigh less than the. It will weigh less than the white corn. Now, also remember, I'm speaking at the same percent of moisture. Please, I forgot to tell you, I'm talking about at the same percent of moisture.

However, the white corn at 40% moisture will feel and look and Be about as dry as the other as the yellow corn is at 18% or 14% moisture and it will keep much better. And offered to an animal, they will always take the one well that's the highest in carbohydrate.

Now, they don't know anything about laboratory experiments, but they can smell the sugar in the whatever you're offering them to eat. And that's what they will govern their choice of food by. So in the last few years and.

### Speaker C

People.

### Speaker B

They have come up with kinesiology. Well, that's what an animal uses with his nose to tell which is best without using the kinesiology.

### Speaker C

So whenever we begin to offer food.

### Speaker B

To animals now many times, and your young stock, not much for chicken, but your young animals, young horses. Horses are especially sensitive when they're not doing so well. If you can give them a choice.

### Speaker C ⏰ 47:21

Of food, they will correct their own diet.

### Speaker B

But when there is no choice, they cannot correct their own diet. The jam out are change it and therefore they have to take what they can get. Also, when animals are ill, if they're in open range, they will generally go.

### Speaker C

Out and eat the herb that they.

### Speaker B

Need to get them well again. But in tins, they cannot do that. There needs to be a lot of research done more on various herbs and plants with animals with certain symptoms in order to find a simple organic, natural way of getting them well.

When I grew up with animals, my father had approximately 200 head of cattle. I can't ever remember him having at any time veterinarian out to any of.

### Speaker C

The cattle because they were in open range. I do remember him having them out.

### Speaker B

Once or twice to horses, but they died anyway, so it didn't make a lot of difference. He had the funeral and the vet bail to pay. But.

### Speaker C

At that time, vets had very.

### Speaker B

Little to deal with as compared with what they had today. In later years, my father told me in his opinion, that the animals had been poisoned because of somebody's jealousy. In other words, someone get mad with.

### Speaker C

You about something and probably you didn't.

### Speaker B

Even know they were mad. They came over and put arsenic in your horse trough and three days later you had a dead horse or a dead mule, dead cow, and all of them died very similar. So it was impossible for a vet to save them anyway.

But I'm not casting any reflection on vets. I was just telling you what happens when animals have an open range. Today it's impossible to have an open range. So we're going to have to try to find ways and means to solve our problems.

Within the means of what we have.

### Speaker C ⏰ 49:52

And where do you think the problem of farming starts today?

### Speaker B

I'm going to ask the class this. Where does the problem of farming begin today? In the soil. That's right. It absolutely begins in the soil. Right. In the soil. Now, if it begins in the soil, I'll ask you another question.

Why is it that only one animal will get sick and all the rest of them won't? Or why is it that 2% or 5% get sick and all of them got the same thing? Why is it that just one animal would get sick and all have the same treatment? Can anybody answer that question? What's that? They're all different. But there's one thing that's different about them.

And what is that? They've only forgot what I told you five minutes ago. What is different about them? The microns is different. Right. So a slight difference in the microns down to the middle microns. It's actually the millimet microns that is different.

That's right, Joe. It's the millimet microns that's different. So there's a genetic difference.

### Speaker C

So therefore, they're going to need a.

### Speaker B

Mineral that is different. Now, where and what element does this deficiency first begin in this animal? What one element does it first begin that they get out of the field? What element? Calcium. Right. Why is calcium so vastly important in an animal, an animal, in our food? Why is it so important? It makes 60% of the dry weight.

Yes. Up to 80%. Yeah, but there's another reason. Why? What is the primary reason? That's where vitamins are most needed. But what manufactures the vitamins? The liver manufactures the vitamins. That's right.

What is the substance of that? Animals and people's liver manufactures. What's the name of it?

### Speaker C ⏰ 52:18

Bile.

### Speaker B

Bile. What is bile? Bile is a dilute form of hydrochloric acid. Well, is hydrochloric acid a base or an acid? Is it? I know what the book says, but it isn't. Don't you know? It is a base. Hydrochloric acid is a base.

Well, for instance, if you dilute hydrochloric acid with distilled water and it's a base, the water being a neutral, then the hydrochloric had to be a base. How do you tell a base from an acid? What distinguishes the difference between a base and an acid? The direction of the rotation of the electron in orbit.

That makes the difference. Now, what determines frequency? What determines frequency? Yes. The.

### Speaker C

Number.

### Speaker B

How many times. But what goes around? What determines Frequency, your synchronization point. Your synchronization point determines the frequency.

### Speaker C

Is there anything hard about this?

### Speaker B

Isn't it easy? Well, for instance, if you took sulfuric acid and mixed it with water, what happens? It heats up, doesn't it? And if you have equal amounts by weight, you have hydrogen peroxide, 2H 2O. Right? So whenever the hydrogen peroxide isn't hot.

### Speaker C

Is has some temperature of the room.

### Speaker B ⏰ 54:20

In which it is. So that is the synchronization point at the point that they blend perfectly at the blending point. I'll say it that way. That's the point at which they blend until there's no more resistance.

Now, when God made the kinds, he made them on frequencies. It sounds like I'm back in devotion again, but actually it's facts. He made them each according to his own kind.

### Speaker C

And he told them to go and.

### Speaker B

Multiply each according to his own frequency. They produced their own kinds.

### Speaker C

Now, who was the first are.

### Speaker B

Men that learned something about animal husbandry, the effects of breeding animals?

### Speaker C

Who was the first man that learned?

### Speaker B

Jacob.

### Speaker C

What did he learn?

### Speaker B

Speckled calves. That's right. He got speckled calves. So therefore he castrated all the solid kind of the burros and on the ears of Spanish and beat his father as one Jew beating another Jew at his own game.

### Speaker C

Because he didn't know anything about.

### Speaker B

Isaac, didn't know anything about the breeding of animals. But Jacob did. What was just as a matter of interest, what was Jacob's first wife name? Leah. That's right. What was his second wife?

### Speaker C

How many years did he work for? 14.

### Speaker B

But I imagine that he paid for her on an installment plan. I don't imagine he had to wait 14 years to get it. He bought her and paid her for an installment after he got her. These are just interesting facts to kind of wet your mind.

Get your mind off of this math for a moment. And now we'll get back to the math. Now, what is the frequency of.

### Speaker C ⏰ 56:39

A horse?

### Speaker B

Can anybody tell me? 44 for a stud and 46 for mare. That's right. What is the frequency of a dog? Of dogs, wolves, coyotes. 38 and 40. That's correct. Now, how many decimals? Four decimals. How many decimals does human beings have? And what's the frequency of human beings? 24 and 26.

Aren't you glad there's a difference? Well, you see, this is putting things down to where you can handle them and you know what to do about it. Now, if you have any.

### Speaker C

Thing with.

### Speaker B

4 decimals.

### Speaker C

It does not Require cooked.

### Speaker B

Food for its existence isn't that easy. It can live off of natural foods. Now, any human being that tries to live off of uncooked foods trying to be an animal, and it won't be long before they look like one.

You know, I heard it said that you could feed any jackass on raw food. Well, so if you can't take your problems and smile about them, it gets you down. Your B3 will get too short. You'll lose the ability to smile.

Let me ask how many of you farmers I want to see your hands on this? Both men and women sing while you work.

### Speaker C ⏰ 58:49

Hold up your hand.

### Speaker B

Yeah. Whistle cats. Well, that's pretty good. That's above the average. You got above that. Most of them don't. Well, why don't you sing? Why don't people sing more? Why don't you sing? Did you ever stop to analyze why you don't sing? You're unhappy.

Happy people sing. So you're unhappy. Why are you unhappy? Figure that one out yourself. You don't have to answer, but this is coming down to the base of your problem. In other words, what I'm trying to get you to do right now at this time is to learn to define your problem and know what your problem is.

If you don't know what your problem is, there's no way to solve it. There's no way to solve it unless.

### Speaker C

You bound your problem.

### Speaker B

But once your problem is bounded, then.

### Speaker C

You start to work on it.

### Speaker B

And if you're too lazy to think, well, hire somebody to think for you that does not have a product to sell. If they got a product to sell.

### Speaker C

And you've got a problem, run for your life. Some of you may have products to sell. Well, God bless her. But try to help the farmer in.

### Speaker B

Such a way that he can buy more of it instead of less of it each year. In other words, his ability to purchase your product depends on his net profit. So try to help him make a profit first and get yours second if that's the way to do it.

### Speaker C

But if you really know what you're.

### Speaker B

Doing, quit selling any product and get out and sell a service. Sell a service without anything attached and you will find that if you turn out the goods that you will have.

### Speaker C ⏰ 60:55

More work than any one human being.

### Speaker B

Can ever do in their life. Now also, when you know, you know. Then when you know, you know. You should know what you're worth.


## Full Transcript

*Complete transcription without speaker identification:*

Like to welcome all of you. To. A course that I have not had. So we're all going to be together. And this is a totally new avenue of this continuing series of the biological theory of ionization. And the reason I'm having, of course, he's told me enough things.

He's taken my gray matter that he told me if I'd have a course, he'd finish. So I'm waiting for the finish, and a lot of things he's told me. And so we got kind of an outline I'm going to have typed up here, and we'll pass out what he's going to kind of COVID And then tonight and tomorrow night, I'll have about an hour and a half to two hours of.1 of the things I want to cover real thoroughly with is what are dairy calves, calf problems, gowers, health problems, and this type of thing.

I'm real fortunate in this area. I have 3,000 pale calves that are shipped in here every winter. And I get a pretty good education how to keep them alive. And you soon find out there's some you cannot keep alive, and I'll tell you why.

And so I'll be covering some of that. And Dr. Eames, he'll be going into his aspects from the biological theory of ionization. Those of you who've had the soils course, he'll be relating that to the. How it affects the animal in quite a little detail.

And. Also give you some tips and things that we can do in the interim here. But the one thing I want you to do and remember when he's lecturing and this type of thing is Dr. Reams thinks of mathematics. And for some of you, that may be hard to understand.

When he gets a thought pattern going. For the benefit of most of us in the room is try to refrain from your question until that thought pattern is done, because otherwise he gets off at it. It's hard for him to get back on a specific pattern.

Now, we're not trying to discourage questions, don't get me wrong. But there is times that it's easier for him to let him finish that and then come back with a question. Now, when a question comes up under that kind of circumstance, it would be best if you could write it down and it would help you greatly.

Then we can pick them up at a different time. But I think this would be the most helpful from that standpoint. When these things do come to mind, a few other things, there will be cassette tapes taped here, and we'll try to get the questions and the Answers as best we can.

I realize that time seems it doesn't always happen, but we'll try to do it. And if you're catching us, we're not doing it often get after us about it because we get going on up here and sometimes we slip up on that.

The tapes that I have, they're a 60 minute tape. I buy the highest quality tape I can buy. They're not cheap tapes and they're $4 apiece from up here. You're welcome to go ahead and record them yourself. I always said in these courses, as long as it doesn't interfere and make a lot of commotion and noise.

Try to use your best discretion, please on that. And on Wednesday night we're going to have a banquet. When Dr. Reams teaches courses, this thing, he likes to have a banquet. So that will be on Wednesday night.

Just come and we'll announce that later. Anyway, there's no charge for that. That'll be in the course here. So with that, Dr. Reams will start and each morning he likes to have a short devotional and then we'll go.

On Dr. Scowl make a difference scaffold. She's clear now. Okay, that's what it is. That's one of them spliced ones in. That's all right. The one mic will work as long. As you can hear it on there. There's no impeacher.

All right? Okay. Good morning. This morning in our morning devotion, we're going to talk to you about a book. The first thought comes in your mind is the Bible. Well, that's one book, but there's a lot of others.

And most of you, most of you fellows were born with television, brought up with it. When I was born, we didn't have television and we had more time for books and we didn't watch television so much and we had more time to watch the girls.

So youth is youth at any time. Not a lot of difference in a. In our ways, but there is difference in the way we plan our time. And the Bible is a book that limits, that is limited by time. In other words, it really begins with time and ends with time.

But the thoughts in it lead us to a perpetual destiny. Not the book itself, but the thoughts that are in it that we can make a part of ourselves. If every one of us or each one of us was limited by a book, progress would almost cease.

It's only that effort, or only that actually wisdom that you use beyond the knowledge of the book that really counts. If you're just going to be a. Teacher Go buy the book. But if you're going to be a progressive farmer, then go beyond the book.

Along about 1937. At 2 o' clock. In the morning, I got a call to a poultry farm about 40 miles away. And I went out to this poultry farm and got there about 4 o'. Clock. And this man had been in the candy business all the days of his.

Life and he was up in his. Early 70s and he had gone into poultry business. And the most up to date standard poultry farm, I guess in the state. He had conveyor belts for feed, conveyor belts for taking out the manures.

And it was really fabulous poultry army. Boilers is what he was going to produce. And he had 75,000 baby chicks come in the same day and 25,000 turkeys. And him brand new, never raised a chicken in his life.

And three days later, it was a. February morning, the humidity dropped and the. Temperature was 85 in the poultry houses and the chicks were dying by the bucketful. And when I got there, there was a pile of baby chicks like you can't believe, and baby turkeys.

You had two or three colored men going through picking out the dead ones. And the chicks were all huddled in one corner making a noise as if they were cold. He had two feed men out there and one man from the university who lived near there, who was supposed to be a specialist in poultry, had been there since about 10 o' clock that night.

The specialist in poultry from the university. When I got out there, they said they had told me that the chicks were poisoning, poisoned on something. And to bring my emergency chip for poisoning. I brought it all right.

But I walked down through the poultry houses from end to end and looked at them. And the first question I asked was. I couldn't see any thermostats in the building, so where are your thermostats? And there was in the building outside where you could set at one place, set the thermostat in any building.

So that took me out to where. The thermostats were and I turned each. One of them up to 100. They said, you're going to cook these chickens. I said, you can't eat them raw. There was a case that the humidity had dropped and the chicks were freezing.

To death at 85 degrees. And in two hours I said, well, aren't you going to test the water and the feed? I said, no, you called me out here to fix it, I've already fixed it. And I said, in two hours there won't be any more chicks dying.

And there were Not. He said, well, there's nothing in the book about that. I said, if they had, you wouldn't have called me. But I'll guarantee you this, it'll be tomorrow. It'll be in the book tomorrow. So this is what I'm telling you.

Go beyond the book. Dare to go beyond the book. Use that head. There's a knot on everybody's shoulder here, and in it there's supposed to be. Some brains, and use them. Go beyond the book. Don't try to be limited by the book unless you're a professor, and then present more than one way of doing a thing.

When I was in college, you only presented one way to do it. I've spent 50 years in research, and I found as many ways to. Prosperity. And also to this poorhouse. Go. By. Your problems. In other words. You don't need a book to have a problem.

And then you need to refresh your memory on what has been done on or about that problem. And if none of the things that's been done on that problem, then do the next best thing. And that then is beginning to solve your problem, is to go beyond the book.

Now, where do you start when you. Go beyond the book? And that is to see everything you look at. You know, most people go through life and they see very little. In the agricultural class, I asked the class how many people knew which way the seed in a watermelon pointed to the rind or to the heart.

And, you know, most. I think there's only two or three in the class. And you, they don't see everything you look at. Pay close attention to everything you see, register it in your mind, and then you can begin to collect points in solving your problem.

But one thing I advise you never to do is never to take your problems to bed with you. Unless she's a female. Don't take your farm problems to bed with you. Your domestic problem. Yes. So. This week we're going to learn.

Things that are not in the book. And you're going to also learn that. The books are for one purpose, and. That is to get you to thinking. Now, if you were in a mechanical school, then you would go buy the book.

But you're not dealing with a mechanical object. You are dealing with a biological life where there isn't any real pattern of perfection as far as putting or taking apart the parts like an automobile. There's no car keys, there's no nuts.

Except the one that's trying to solve the problem. He can be a part of the answer instead of a part of the. Problem, the farmer of tomorrow and the. Minister of the gospel of tomorrow that is most successful is going to be the one that does their own thinking, collects their own prejudices and sets a precedent for themselves and keeps their mouths shut about how they made their progress.

Because you will find the thing that. Worked for you does not work for your neighbor. Always. Sometimes he does. Once in a while, down in Georgia, there was Jed. A friend called up his friend Jed and said, jed said, when your mule was sick, what did you do for him? Jed said, I gave him a quart of turpentine.

So Jed met him on the street on Saturday night. Rob said, how's your mule? He said, that quarter turpentine killed him. Jet said, it killed my viewer too. So sometimes with your remedies, you need to find out what the result is before you apply the remedy.

So what I'm trying to say is let's put some horse sense behind our farming, behind our practices, behind our religion and works. Now, in regard to our morning devotion. This morning I want to leave you one main thought.

I find when I leave over three, you forget all of them. But if I just leave you one or two, you remember them and can. Take them home with you. And that is that. Duty to God or service to God begins where duty ends.

Service to God begins where duty ends. Don't forget that. Because as long as you're doing your duty, that's not service for God. So you must go beyond duty in order to be of value. And it's only that part of your life that you go beyond.

Duty that pays high dividends, and I tell you how high it will pay. Then your paycheck becomes, or your net profit becomes God's report card. When we're in school, we work for a grade. But when we're in life, we work for remuneration of some kind.

But then your paycheck is God's report card. How well pleased he is with you. I'm going to give you a verse of Scripture. Now for my second thought in the scripture this morning. This one you will find in Amos, the book of Amos, the third chapter.

And seventh verse. In the King James Version. It says, I will not. The Lord is speaking to Amos, and he said this. I will not do anything except that which I will reveal to my prophets. Some of the translations are italics, if they ask me, which it is understood without the italics.

So one of the things to do in farming, when all biological life is depending upon God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, communication with you is to ask him what you don't know the answer to. That's where I got my answers.

And I don't have them all. I just have a few of them that works. And we're going to learn about those. Answers or some of those things this week. But go beyond the book. Even in your spiritual life, go beyond the book.

Go to the point that when Jesus said, my sheep know my voice, go until you hear his voice. In order to hear his voice, you're going to have to turn off the television for a few hours on the radio or the hum of the tractor.

You're going to have to listen. And there's no time better in life to listen than in the night when you are awake. And the more awake you are at night, the healthier you are. You don't need the rest. No one has ever died from lack of sleep.

But the cemetery is full of people who died from worrying about it. When you're ill and sick, or if you're dead tired at night, if you're dead tired at night, you're sick. But if you got a lot of energy in the evening, your reserve energy is higher.

So take care of your health and then you can think straight. Sick people can't think straight. So then also you're going to find it's the same thing in biological life that keeps you thinking straight as well as theological life.

You've got to be able to have the right foods to think straight. I believe there. I believe that the farmers of tomorrow. Can be our nation's finest doctors. And that many of them will be if they produce a high quality food and they know what they have and.

They know how to market it. And that's what we're going to study. About this week is how to have a higher quality food at lower cost per package and get a premium price in the market. I'll give you an example.

Right now in Boston we are paying up to 50 cents apiece for a little grapefruit. And the farmer in Florida is getting. A dollar for two bushels, a hundred grapefruit. Just think of that. Just think of it. Well, there's a lot of.

There's too much loss between the farmer and the retail market. Now a year ago in Boston about over the United States, we were paying $7, well, $7.50 to $8 at this time of year, end of January, for lemons.

We're paying $22.50 now for the same box of lemons, not because they had. A short crop, but because a lot. Of People are drinking lemonade. A lot of people become more in demand and there are going to be more demand.

So supply and demand is what causes. Prices to go up. But also remember this, that the market has never been flooded with top quality produce. There is always a great demand for top quality produce. And you know, the church has never been flooded with real saints of God.

Real saints of God whose faith, whose. Faith. Is backed up by works. Faith without works is dead. And by their fruits ye shall know them. A saint of God is a peculiar person in that it is impossible to insult one.

They are insult proof. They are so busy attending to God's. Business until they don't have time to attend to the neighbor's business. And consequently they have a good report. Card and have a good paycheck.

Also. The person that's so busy in. The churches tending to other people's business don't have very much fruit and they criticize everybody else's. But remember this, as farmers, as men in a community, as a part of our government, it takes a lot less energy to push anyone up than it does to push them down.

Because when you push them down, they're. Going to resist it. And I've never seen a man resist being pushed up. Also, it takes twice as much energy to get up after you've gone down with them as it would to push.

Them up in the first place. So let's conserve our energy. Everything we say, everything we do depends. On energy of some kind. Our lives as what we are depends on spiritual energy. Our progress in the farm depends on spiritual energy.

The crop grows on life given from God. You can't put life in a seed. You can't put life in a hill of grass. You can't put life in a hill of corn. But God can. So start giving him the credit and believe me, he'll give you the cash.

Isn't that a fair exchange? This is my morning devotion to you this morning. I'm going to ask that you think much upon it, take it home with you what you can, and use it. For the glory of God. Father, we thank you this morning for this time and this morning devotion.

We thank you for the opportunity of. Coming before these and share the wisdom. That you have given to us. There are many new thoughts, many new ways, many new ideas, as much progress. At hand that has not been used.

And may each of us go home a little better prepared to handle the problems that you have given us to strengthen our faith than we find ourselves. When we first come here. Answer this prayer, dear Father and We.

Will give you the praise throughout eternity. Open our minds today as have never been opened. And touch us by Thy Holy Spirit, Father, as we've never been touched. And teach us how dependent we are. Upon Thee, and we'll thank you forever and ever perpetually.

Amen. So how many of you are attending. This class that I have taught or Dr. Stowers taught. For the first time? One that either one of us has never taught. How many of you are new in this class? Hold up your hands.

Okay. There's quite a few. For the old. Ones here has had some of the teaching. I want to give a very few minutes review. Energy. Everything that moves, moves on energy. And when I went to college, an. Atom was thought to be the smallest.

Thing that there was because that is the smallest division of an element. An atom is the smallest way that an atom can be divided. But the thought came to me, if an atom was the smallest thing that there is, why aren't all atoms alike? Why is one silver? Why is one gold? Why is one carbon? Why is one hydrogen? Why is one nitrogen? And all this was questioned in my mind also when I was a boy from 6 to 12 years old.

My nickname was Question Box. And most people did not know my. Given name other than Question Box, because. I wanted to know the answer to so many things. I'll give you an example. I wanted to know if we ate.

Chicken, why we didn't grow feathers on us, and if we ate beef, why we didn't have horns and a tail. And nobody could answer my question. I mean, this thing was really a perplexing question to me. It wasn't that I was trying to be silly or foolish.

I really wanted to know the answer and thousands of other questions. I was an eternal killer asking questions. And one question I asked was, when you sell out sweet potatoes, why do. You cut them early in the morning.

Throw them out in the sun all day and let the vines wilt, and then stick them in the ground late in the afternoon? Why don't you set them out whenever they're fresh and tender? Well, when I got to be a man, I set them out. When they were fresh and tender.

You know what happened? They all rotted off at the ground. So I had to throw them out and let them wilt. But nobody could answer my question. The only answer I got, well, that's the way my daddy did it. And that's the way his daddy did it.

And that's the way his daddy did it. And, you know, most farmers today are about 40 years behind in Progressive scientific practices. We have not turned loose the old, we did not dare to try the new. And we expect these things to just turn out in luck.

And today, if you take the gamble. Out of farmers, most farmers would quit. They love the gamble of it more than they really love the progressive accuracy of it. Well, we can be a lot more accurate. Now, back to the atom.

Well, there had to be a difference somewhere. But I was taught that in an. Atom there was the same number of protons as neutrons. Well, I was also taught in college by the university that negatives attract positives, the opposites attract each other.

But yet there was Bayer's law, there. Was Bond's law, there was Fermi's law. All saying that, like, things attract each other, which was the conclusion of these laws. One dealing with solids, one dealing with gases, and one dealing with solids and gases.

All of them ended with a conclusion that light things attract each other. Well, if light things attracted each other, how is it that opposites attract each other? Well. I didn't find the answer, but I wasn't satisfied.

So in my research, I came up. With these facts, and they can be. Proven that there is not the same number of protons as neutrons. Because if you did, everything would have the same specific gravity and everything would revert back to the line of least resistance or the ratio of one to one in dehydrogen.

That's just common sense. As a fourth grader could think that one out. Now, I did learn to find out why atoms are made up of anions and cations. But how many and how much? Well, an anion is the smallest thing.

That God ever made, and it's singular. And they're always in their singular, they're. Never in their plural. And they're so small, you cannot cut one in two. You cannot divide it, you cannot take it apart.

It comes as a whole. Yet recall one anion to 499 anions. An anion we still consider regardless of the number. Consider it an anion. Now, it's like putting a container here. With marbles in it. You don't take the marbles apart, but.

You can take out some other marbles. Now, one marble would represent one Milhouse unit of energy. One marble would represent. Limits of the power of an anion is from 1 to 499 milhouse units of energy. A single cation contains 500 mil house units of energy.

It's just a little bit bigger marble. In other words, at the same temperature and pressure, it would be 500 times larger than A single anion would be the size of one cation. The cation Milhouse units of energy are from 500 to 999 Milhouse units of energy.

You're going to need this when you. Get into the feed this week. Feeding of animals and the growth of animals. Going to need this information. We're just going to let you peep through the keyhole at it this week, though.

And if you need to know more. About it and have not taken the agriculture course, then come and get that. Because the. Progress of the farm begins in the field, not in the barn. Also, let's call 1 mill house unit.

Whether it has 500 mil house units or 999, it's still considered 1 milhouse unit. And discussing it there again, you just. Got a bigger marble. You can't divide the marbles, so. But you can divide the strength of your milhouse units, but you're not dividing any single milhouse units unit, whether it is a cationic or anionic.

Now, the anionic is the negative or the alkali, and the cationic is the positive. Also, the anionic is the negative. And. The cationic is the positive, carries the positive. So in this. In this we will find the secret of the atom.

Now, an atom, you have two kinds of atoms. You have the negative and the positive atoms. And some of the things I'm going. To tell you here in the class is going to be exactly opposite from what you've learned in college.

Well, all I say is, don't believe a word I say. Go prove me wrong. Go out and prove me wrong. Because I have already worked with it. 50 years in a laboratory, and I find that it works whether I understand it or not.

And this is the way I explain what appears to me to be the truth. For instance, an atom, hydrogen, has one negative and one positive or one anion and one cation in its singular form and its smallest existence of an atom of hydrogen one to one.

So that is why we compare all ph readings to hydrogen, because it's the simple atom, it's the simplest form. So we compare our ph ratios to hydrogen atom. A carbon atom is always positive. The anions are on the inside and the cations are the electrons on the outside.

Also, in a positive substance, the electron travels counterclockwise when you're looking directly at the spectrum of the atom. And a negative or an anionic travels clockwise. And that's the way energy is created by the resistance.

Now, here's the key. Between the resistance between Anions and cations with different Milhouse units of power versus cations with different mill house units of power versus anions and cations. So there you have the three forces and three ways by which all energy is made.

Now, what's so important about that? When you go feed it, are you going to feed a cow or a horse or a chicken or yourself or your family? Well, that is the principle. That is the biological law by which life exists.

Mr. Einstein taught us how to move. An object from A to B in. The same direction or from A back. To A if you go far enough. But he did not teach us how to move it from B back to A regardless of the distance.

So in the biological realm and in the silver plating, nickel plating, chromium plating realm, it can be done. Otherwise your atoms become actually unharnessed and completed. But in this other realm. In the.

Realm of E equals MC squared, there's only a loss of energy. But in the other two forms that we give, in the class of agriculture, you have a gain of energy, collective energy. If that wasn't true, nothing would grow.

There would be no sizes. Everything would be. Well, actually, there wouldn't be any life upon this planet. There's one more thought I want to. Bring to you in this regard, and that is the colloidal elements, the colloidal elements.

There's two kinds of colloids. One kind of colloid is a measurement of size measured in millionths of microns. The other one is a measure of a compound that each mouth contains all elements within that compound and cannot be taken apart.

There always were just so many of. Them and no more. That cannot be created or made only by God himself. In the beginning, about 3% of our bone is a colloidal substance, and that is what makes our teeth and our bones.

And also the fiber of plants is largely made up or mineralized by colloidal particles. Remember, here's another law of physics that. I'm going to give you, and don't you forget it. Don't forget it. 80% of all the food for animals and plants comes from the air.

They only get 20% through the mouth. Of what they eat. 80% comes from the air. We're going to go into that more a little later in the class, but remember that 80%. So therefore we can conclude that we do not live off the food we eat.

We live off of the energy from. The food we eat. Now back to the colloid. The colloid in nature is what the jewel is to the watch. It's 100% available. It does not have to be digested as such. It is never a part of the soul of the plant or the person or the animal.

It is a part of the energy that can be lost and therefore taken up to be used by another plant. Or animal or person. So these are factors that you're going. To need to know. Now. Another factor that bothered me as a.

Boy. Began when I was five years old. A minister, circuit rider minister, who came around once a month, preached on the resurrection of the dead. But he went home with my parents. That day, and. While we were having dinner.

I said to him, I don't believe what you said today, preacher. My father and mother's face all clouded up. I knew I'd said something wrong with just being a little boy. I didn't know what it was. He said, what did I say that you did not understand? I said, well, you said that when people die, they go to the grave.

And when Jesus comes, he's going to open the graves and take them to heaven with them. And don't you know when people die or when things die, they go to dust and you can't put them together again. You say, well, you're just a child now, but when you're a man, you'll understand these things.

Well, I didn't understand them. The martyrs burned at the stake, the. People buried at sea, eaten by the. Fishes and scattered all over the earth. It became almost an impossibility to me. I did not understand it.

It was a massive confusion of impossibility. My problem was I was trying to bring God down to my size. But in 1934, a couple of police officers brought into my laboratory some ashes from a building that was burned and said, can you tell us whether this was an animal or a person that was burned in this building? The undertaker had been a lifelong friend of my father, about my father's age.

He had a crematory, and I borrowed ashes from him and I determined the. But people live on frequencies, and I determine the frequency. And in those ashes there were not one person. There was three people because their frequency was the same.

But there was three different micronages. And the metamicronids denoted that there were black people. And when I gave this report to the police department, they said there was a woman, colored woman. I was in colored town.

This building burned, and her son and daughter were missing. I could not tell anything about the age, but my description was close enough that it became a closed case of that. So I learned the frequency upon which people live.

And I was already doing research upon plants on the frequency they live and animals on the frequency they live. And Dr. Northrup of Germany taught me. The frequency of grapes. But he didn't exactly explain all to me in his broken German that I didn't very well understand all the details of his experiment, but he did teach.

Me the frequency of grapes. Now, once you know the frequency, then you know the diet. That's just a matter of mathematical calculation. And also the frequency of cattle. Just take cattle, deer, buffalo, moose, elk is all the same.

They're all on the same frequency. But all varieties of sheep is on a different one. And goats another. All variety of hogs, regardless of what. You might call them, are on the same frequency. Whether they're wild or tame, it doesn't make any difference.

But the micronids determines the species that separates the species. But in human beings, we don't think of species, but yet we think of differences. And the millimicronage determines the color. The metamicronage is the path of the.

Electron in orbit that determines the color because of the prism of light. Now, all this has a lot to do with feeding an animal. You know that anything with a yellow color to it has more vitamin A in it than other things it doesn't have, like carrots.

Yellow corn has more vitamin A in it than white corn. But white corn and the same soil, generally, if there's enough calcium in the soil, will have more carbohydrate in it. So that's why people grow white corn.

To eat and yellow corn to feed their animals. Also yellow corn, the grains shrink up. A little bit more. It doesn't carry the high carbon content. Therefore, the volume will weigh a pound or two more per bushel, but yet be more deficient in mineral in that bushel than the bushel of yellow corn.

Now, that's the only exception, just about that. I know when there can be a small deficiency in mineral and an increase in weight. But most of the time, any increase in weight in carbohydrates means an increase in carbohydrates.

An increase in carbohydrate generally means an increase in weight. Now, if you bring your yellow corn. To the maximum of its carbohydrate and the same percentage, then it will weigh less than the. It will weigh less than the white corn.

Now, also remember, I'm speaking at the same percent of moisture. Please, I forgot to tell you, I'm talking about at the same percent of moisture. However, the white corn at 40% moisture will feel and look and Be about as dry as the other as the yellow corn is at 18% or 14% moisture and it will keep much better.

And offered to an animal, they will always take the one well that's the highest in carbohydrate. Now, they don't know anything about laboratory experiments, but they can smell the sugar in the whatever you're offering them to eat.

And that's what they will govern their choice of food by. So in the last few years and. People. They have come up with kinesiology. Well, that's what an animal uses with his nose to tell which is best without using the kinesiology.

So whenever we begin to offer food. To animals now many times, and your young stock, not much for chicken, but your young animals, young horses. Horses are especially sensitive when they're not doing so well.

If you can give them a choice. Of food, they will correct their own diet. But when there is no choice, they cannot correct their own diet. The jam out are change it and therefore they have to take what they can get.

Also, when animals are ill, if they're in open range, they will generally go. Out and eat the herb that they. Need to get them well again. But in tins, they cannot do that. There needs to be a lot of research done more on various herbs and plants with animals with certain symptoms in order to find a simple organic, natural way of getting them well.

When I grew up with animals, my father had approximately 200 head of cattle. I can't ever remember him having at any time veterinarian out to any of. The cattle because they were in open range. I do remember him having them out.

Once or twice to horses, but they died anyway, so it didn't make a lot of difference. He had the funeral and the vet bail to pay. But. At that time, vets had very. Little to deal with as compared with what they had today.

In later years, my father told me in his opinion, that the animals had been poisoned because of somebody's jealousy. In other words, someone get mad with. You about something and probably you didn't. Even know they were mad.

They came over and put arsenic in your horse trough and three days later you had a dead horse or a dead mule, dead cow, and all of them died very similar. So it was impossible for a vet to save them anyway.

But I'm not casting any reflection on vets. I was just telling you what happens when animals have an open range. Today it's impossible to have an open range. So we're going to have to try to find ways and means to solve our problems.

Within the means of what we have. And where do you think the problem of farming starts today? I'm going to ask the class this. Where does the problem of farming begin today? In the soil. That's right. It absolutely begins in the soil.

Right. In the soil. Now, if it begins in the soil, I'll ask you another question. Why is it that only one animal will get sick and all the rest of them won't? Or why is it that 2% or 5% get sick and all of them got the same thing? Why is it that just one animal would get sick and all have the same treatment? Can anybody answer that question? What's that? They're all different.

But there's one thing that's different about them. And what is that? They've only forgot what I told you five minutes ago. What is different about them? The microns is different. Right. So a slight difference in the microns down to the middle microns.

It's actually the millimet microns that is different. That's right, Joe. It's the millimet microns that's different. So there's a genetic difference. So therefore, they're going to need a. Mineral that is different.

Now, where and what element does this deficiency first begin in this animal? What one element does it first begin that they get out of the field? What element? Calcium. Right. Why is calcium so vastly important in an animal, an animal, in our food? Why is it so important? It makes 60% of the dry weight.

Yes. Up to 80%. Yeah, but there's another reason. Why? What is the primary reason? That's where vitamins are most needed. But what manufactures the vitamins? The liver manufactures the vitamins. That's right.

What is the substance of that? Animals and people's liver manufactures. What's the name of it? Bile. Bile. What is bile? Bile is a dilute form of hydrochloric acid. Well, is hydrochloric acid a base or an acid? Is it? I know what the book says, but it isn't.

Don't you know? It is a base. Hydrochloric acid is a base. Well, for instance, if you dilute hydrochloric acid with distilled water and it's a base, the water being a neutral, then the hydrochloric had to be a base.

How do you tell a base from an acid? What distinguishes the difference between a base and an acid? The direction of the rotation of the electron in orbit. That makes the difference. Now, what determines frequency? What determines frequency? Yes.

The. Number. How many times. But what goes around? What determines Frequency, your synchronization point. Your synchronization point determines the frequency. Is there anything hard about this? Isn't it easy? Well, for instance, if you took sulfuric acid and mixed it with water, what happens? It heats up, doesn't it? And if you have equal amounts by weight, you have hydrogen peroxide, 2H 2O.

Right? So whenever the hydrogen peroxide isn't hot. Is has some temperature of the room. In which it is. So that is the synchronization point at the point that they blend perfectly at the blending point. I'll say it that way.

That's the point at which they blend until there's no more resistance. Now, when God made the kinds, he made them on frequencies. It sounds like I'm back in devotion again, but actually it's facts. He made them each according to his own kind.

And he told them to go and. Multiply each according to his own frequency. They produced their own kinds. Now, who was the first are. Men that learned something about animal husbandry, the effects of breeding animals? Who was the first man that learned? Jacob.

What did he learn? Speckled calves. That's right. He got speckled calves. So therefore he castrated all the solid kind of the burros and on the ears of Spanish and beat his father as one Jew beating another Jew at his own game.

Because he didn't know anything about. Isaac, didn't know anything about the breeding of animals. But Jacob did. What was just as a matter of interest, what was Jacob's first wife name? Leah. That's right.

What was his second wife? How many years did he work for? 14. But I imagine that he paid for her on an installment plan. I don't imagine he had to wait 14 years to get it. He bought her and paid her for an installment after he got her.

These are just interesting facts to kind of wet your mind. Get your mind off of this math for a moment. And now we'll get back to the math. Now, what is the frequency of. A horse? Can anybody tell me? 44 for a stud and 46 for mare.

That's right. What is the frequency of a dog? Of dogs, wolves, coyotes. 38 and 40. That's correct. Now, how many decimals? Four decimals. How many decimals does human beings have? And what's the frequency of human beings? 24 and 26.

Aren't you glad there's a difference? Well, you see, this is putting things down to where you can handle them and you know what to do about it. Now, if you have any. Thing with. 4 decimals. It does not Require cooked.

Food for its existence isn't that easy. It can live off of natural foods. Now, any human being that tries to live off of uncooked foods trying to be an animal, and it won't be long before they look like one.

You know, I heard it said that you could feed any jackass on raw food. Well, so if you can't take your problems and smile about them, it gets you down. Your B3 will get too short. You'll lose the ability to smile.

Let me ask how many of you farmers I want to see your hands on this? Both men and women sing while you work. Hold up your hand. Yeah. Whistle cats. Well, that's pretty good. That's above the average. You got above that.

Most of them don't. Well, why don't you sing? Why don't people sing more? Why don't you sing? Did you ever stop to analyze why you don't sing? You're unhappy. Happy people sing. So you're unhappy. Why are you unhappy? Figure that one out yourself.

You don't have to answer, but this is coming down to the base of your problem. In other words, what I'm trying to get you to do right now at this time is to learn to define your problem and know what your problem is.

If you don't know what your problem is, there's no way to solve it. There's no way to solve it unless. You bound your problem. But once your problem is bounded, then. You start to work on it. And if you're too lazy to think, well, hire somebody to think for you that does not have a product to sell.

If they got a product to sell. And you've got a problem, run for your life. Some of you may have products to sell. Well, God bless her. But try to help the farmer in. Such a way that he can buy more of it instead of less of it each year.

In other words, his ability to purchase your product depends on his net profit. So try to help him make a profit first and get yours second if that's the way to do it. But if you really know what you're.

Doing, quit selling any product and get out and sell a service. Sell a service without anything attached and you will find that if you turn out the goods that you will have. More work than any one human being.

Can ever do in their life. Now also, when you know, you know. Then when you know, you know. You should know what you're worth.
