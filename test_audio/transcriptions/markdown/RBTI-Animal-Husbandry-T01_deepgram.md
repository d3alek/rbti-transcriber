I'd like to welcome all of you to a course that I have not had, so we're all gonna be together. And, this is a totally new avenue of this continuing series of the biological theory of ionization. And, the reason I'm having is of course he's told me enough things and he's taken my great matter that he told me if I had a course he'd finish.

So I'm waiting for the finish and a lot of things he's told me. And, so we got kind of an outline I'm gonna have typed up here and we'll pass out and what he's gonna kinda cover. And then, tonight and tomorrow night, I'll have about, an hour and a half, two hours of, one of the things I wanna cover real thoroughly with is what are dairy calves, calf problems, scours, calve problems, and this type of thing.

I'm real fortunate in this area. Have 3,000 pale calves that are shipped in here every winter and I get a pretty good education. I keep them alive and you soon find out there's some you cannot keep alive and I'll tell you why.

And so I'll be covering some of that and Doctor. Eames will be going into his aspects from biological theory of ionization. Both of you who have had the soils course, he'll be relating that to the how it affects the animal in quite a little detail and also give you some tips and things that we can do in the interim here.

But the one thing I want you to do and remember when he's lecturing and this type of thing is that Doctor. Reams thinks the mathematics and for some of you that may be hard to understand. When he gets a thought pattern going, for the benefit of most of us in the room, is try to refrain from your questions until that thought pattern is done because otherwise he gets off at it and hard for him to get back on a specific pattern.

Now we're not trying to discourage questions. Don't get me wrong. But there is times that it's easier for him to let him finish that and then come back with a question. Now when a question comes up under that kind of a circumstance, it'd be best if you could write it down and it would help you greatly.

Then we can pick them up at a at a different time, but I think this would be the most helpful from that standpoint when these things do come to mind. Now a few other things, the, there will be cassette tapes taped here and we'll try to get the questions and the answers as best we can.

I realize the time seems going with it doesn't always happen, but we'll try to try to do it and if you catch this, we're not doing it often, get after us about it because we get going on up here and and sometimes we slip up on that. The tapes that I have, they're a sixty minute tape.

I buy the the highest quality tape I can buy. They're not cheap tape and, they're $4 apiece from up here. You're welcome to go ahead and record them yourself. I've always said in these courses, as long as it doesn't interfere and make a lot of commotion and noise.

Now try to use your best discretion, please, on that. And on Wednesday night, we're gonna have a banquet. When doctor reams teaches courses, this thing, he likes to have a banquet. So that'll be on Wednesday night.

Just come and we'll announce that later anyway. There's no charge for that. That'll be with the course here. So with that, my, doctor Rings will start. And each morning, he likes to have a short devotional, and then we'll go on.

Doctor. Still getting a buzz in this thing. Does it make a difference? Yeah. She's clear. Okay. That's what it is. That's the one of them spliced ones in. Suppose. So that's alright. The one might go work. Just as long as you can hear it on there and there's no one beating, you're alright.

Okay.

### Speaker 1 ⏰ 03:34

Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good This morning, in our morning devotion, we're gonna talk to you about a book. The first thought comes in your mind is the bible. Well, that's one book, but there's a lot of others.

And most of you most of you fellows were born in with television brought up with it. Well, when I was born, we didn't have television, and we had more time for books. And we didn't watch television so much, and we had more time to watch the girls.

Youth is youth at any time. Not a lot of difference in our ways, but there is difference in our way we plan our time. And the Bible is a book that limits, that is limited by time. In other words, it really begins with time and ends with time, but the thoughts in it lead us to a perpetual destiny, not the book itself, but the thoughts that are in it that we can make a part of ourselves.

If every one of us or each one of us was limited by a book, progress would almost cease. It's only that effort or only that, actually, wisdom that you use beyond the knowledge of the book that really counts.

If you're just going to be a teacher, go buy the book. But if you're going to be a progressive farmer, then go beyond the book. Along about nineteen thirty seven at 02:00 in the morning, I got a call to a poultry farm about 40 miles away.

And I went out to this poultry farm and got there about 04:00. And this man had been in the candy business all the days of his life, and he was up in his early seventies. And he had gone in the poultry business, and the most up to date standard poultry farm, I guess, the state.

He had conveyor belts for feed, conveyor belts for taking out the manures, and it was it was really a fabulous soldier on the bottlers as what he was going to produce. And he had 75,000 baby chicks come in the same day and 25,000 turkeys.

And him, brand new, never raised a chicken in his life. And three days later, it was a February morning, the humidity dropped and the temperature was 85 in the poultry houses, and the chicks were dying by the bucketfuls.

And when I got there, there was a pile of baby chicks like you can't believe in baby turkeys. We had two or three colored men going through, picking out the dead ones, and the chicks were all huddled in one corner, making a noise as if they were cold.

We had two feed men out there and one man from the university who lived near there who was supposed to be a specialist in poultry, I've been there since about 10:00 that night. The specialist in poultry from the university.

Well, when I got out there, he they said they told me that the chicks were poisoning poisoned on something and to bring my emergency kit for poisoning. I brought it already, but I walked down through the poultry houses from end to end and looked at them.

And the first question I asked is where where I couldn't see any thermostats in the building. So I said, where are your thermostats? And I was in the building outside where you could set at one place, set the thermostat in any building.

So they took me out to where the thermostats were, and I turned each one of them up to 100. They said, you're going to cook these chickens. I said, you can't eat them raw. Well, that was a case that the humidity had dropped and the chicks were freezing to death at 85 degrees.

And in in two hours, I said, well, aren't you gonna test the water in the field? I said, no. You call me out here to fix it. I've already fixed it. And I said in two hours, there won't be any more chicks dying, and there were not.

They said, well, there's nothing in the book about that. I said, if they had, you wouldn't have called me, but I'll guarantee you this. It would be tomorrow. It'll be in the book tomorrow. So this is what I'm telling you.

Go beyond the book. Dare to go beyond the book. Use that head. There's a knot on everybody's shoulder here, and in it, there's supposed to be some brains, and use them. Go beyond the book. Don't try to be limited by the book unless you're a professor, and then present more than one way of doing, I think.

When I was in college, I only presented one way to do it. I've spent fifty years in research, and I found there's many ways to prosperity and also to this poor house. Go buy, your problems. In other words, you don't need a book till you have a problem.

And then you need to refresh your memory on what has been done on or about that problem. And if none of the things has been done on that problem, then do the next best thing. And that then is beginning to solve your problem as to go beyond the book.

Now, where do you start when you when you go beyond the book? And that is to see everything you look at. You know, most people go through life and they see very little. In the agricultural class, I asked the class how many people knew which way the seed in a watermelon pointed to the rind or to the heart.

And you know most I think there's only two or three in a class that do. They don't see everything you look at. Pay close attention to everything you see. Register it in your mind, and then you can begin to collect points in solving your problem.

But one thing I advise you never to do is never to take your problems to bed with you unless it's just a female. Don't take your farm problems to bed with you. Your domestic problem, yes. So in this week, we're going to learn things that are not in the book.

And you're going to also learn that the books are for one purpose, and that is to get you to thinking. Now if you were in a mechanical school, then you would go by the book, but you're not dealing with a a mechanical object.

You are dealing with a biological life where there isn't any real pattern of perfection as far as putting or taking apart the parts. Like an automobile, There's no car to keys. There's no nuts except the one that's trying to solve the problem.

And it can be a part of the answer instead of a part of the problem. The farmer tomorrow of tomorrow and the minister of the gospel of tomorrow that is most successful is going to be the one that does their own thinking, collects their own prejudices, and sets a precedent for themselves and keep their mouths shut about how they made their progress because you will find the thing that worked for you does not work for your neighbor always.

They'll be or sometimes it does once in a while. Down in Georgia, there was Jed a friend called up his friend Jed and said, Jed said, when your mule was set, what did you do for him? Jed said, I gave him a quart of turpentine.

So Jed met him on the street on Saturday night, and said, well, I said, how's your view? He said that that quart of turpentine killed him. Jed said it killed my viewer too. So sometimes with your remedies, need to find out what the result is before you apply the remedy.

So what I'm trying to say is let's put some hoarse sense behind our farming, behind our practices, behind our religion, and works. Now in regard to our morning devotion this morning, I'm gonna leave you one main thought.

I find when I leave over three, you forget all of them. But if I just leave you one or two, you'll remember them and can take them home with you. And that is that duty to God or service to God begins where duty ends.

Service to God begins where duty ends. Don't forget that. Because long as you're doing your duty, that's not service for God. So you must go beyond duty in order to be of value. And it's only that part of your life that you go beyond duty that pays high dividends.

And I tell you how high it will pay. Then your paycheck becomes or your net profit becomes God's report card. When we're in school, we work for a grade. But when we're in life, we work for remuneration of some kind.

But then your paycheck is God's report card, how well pleased he is with you. I'm gonna give you a verse of scripture now for my second thought in the scripture this morning. And that this one you will find in the Amos, the book of Amos, the third chapter and seventh verse.

In the King James version, it says this, I will not the Lord is speaking to Amos, and he said this, I will not do anything except that which I will reveal to my to my prophets. And some of the translations is italics if they ask me, which is understood without the italics.

So one of the things to do in farming when all biological life is depending upon God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit Communication with you is to ask him what you don't know the answer to. That's where I got my answers.

And I don't have them all. I just have a few of them that works. And we're gonna learn about those answers or some of those things this week. But go beyond the book. Even in your spiritual life, go beyond the book.

Go to the point that when Jesus said, my sheep know my voice, go until you hear his voice. In order to hear his voice, you're gonna have to turn off the television for a few hours in the radio or the of the tractor.

You're gonna have to listen. And there's no time better in life to listen than in the night when you are awake. And the more awake you are at night, the healthier you are. You don't need the rest. No one has ever died from lack of sleep, but the cemetery is full of people who died from worrying about it.

When you're ill and sick or if you're if you're dead tired at night if you're dead tired at night, you're sick. But if you got a lot of energy in the evening, your reserve energy is higher. So take care of your health, and then you can think straight.

Sick people can't think straight. So then also you're going to find it's the same thing in biological life that keeps you thinking straight And all of and as well as theological life, you've got to be able to have the right foods to think straight.

I believe, thoroughly believe, that the farmers of tomorrow can be our nation's finest doctors and that many of them will be if they produce a high quality food and they know what they have and they know how to market it. And that's what we're going to study about this week is how to have a higher quality food at lower cost per package and get a premium price in the market.

I'll give you an example. Right now in Boston, we are paying up to 50¢ apiece for little grapefruit. And the farmer in Florida is getting a dollar for two bushels, a 100 grade food. Just think of that. Just think of it.

Well, there's a lot of there's there's too much loss between the farmer and the retail market. Now a year ago in Boston, well, about over The United States, we were paying $7, well, $7.50 to $8 at this time of year, January.

For lemons, we're paying $22.50 now for the same box of lemons, not because they had a short crop, but because a lot of people are drinking lemonade. A lot of people have become more in demand, and there are gonna be more more demand.

So supply and demand is what causes prices to go up. But, also, remember this, that the market has never been flooded with top quality produce. There's always a great demand for top quality produce. And you know the church has never been flooded with real saints of God.

Real saints of God that's whose faith whose faith is backed up by works. Faith without works is dead, and by their fruits ye shall know them. A saint of God is a peculiar person. In that, it is impossible to insult one.

They're insult proof. They are so busy attending to God's business until they don't have time to attend to the neighbor's business. And consequently, they have a good report card and have a good paycheck.

Also, the person that's so busy in the churches tending to other people's business don't have very much fruit and they criticize everybody else's. But remember this, as farmers, as men in a community, as a part of our government, it's a lot it takes a lot less energy to push anyone up than it does to push them down.

Because when you push them down, they're going to resist it. And I've never seen a man resist being pushed up. And, also, it takes twice as much energy to get up after you've gone down with them as it were to push them up in the first place.

So us conserve our energy. Everything we say, everything we do depends on energy of some kind. Our lives as what we are depends on spiritual energy. Our progress in the farm depends on spiritual energy. The crop grows on on life given from God.

You can't put life in a seed. You can't put life in a hill of grass. You can't put life in a hill of corn, but God can. So start giving him the credit. And believe me, he'll give you the cash. Is now a fair exchange? This is my morning devotion to you this morning.

I'm going to ask that you think much upon it, take it home with you what you can, and use it for the glory of God. Father, we thank you this morning for this time in this morning devotion. We thank you for the opportunity of coming before these and share the wisdom that you have given to us.

There are many new thoughts, many new ways, many new ideas, as much progress at hand as has not been used, and may each of us go home a little better prepared to handle the problems that you have given us to strengthen our faith than we than we find ourselves when we first come here. Answer this prayer, dear father, and we will give you the praise throughout eternity.

Open our minds today as have never been opened, and touch us by thy holy spirit, father, as we've never been touched. And teach us how dependent we are upon thee, I will thank you forever and ever, perpetually.

Amen. So how many of you are attending this class any or the class that I have taught or doctor Stiles taught for the because not for the first time, one that either one of us has never taught, how many of you are new new in this class? Hold up your hands.

Okay. There's quite a few. For your if you for the old ones that's here, they has had some of the teaching, I wanna give a very few minutes with you on energy. Everything that moves, moves on energy. And when I went to college, an atom was thought to be the smallest thing that there was because that is the smallest division of an element.

An atom is the smallest way that an atom can be divided. But the thought came to me, if an atom was the smallest thing that that there is, why aren't all atoms alike? Why is one silver? Why is one gold? Why is one carbon? Why is one hydrogen? Why is one nitrogen? And all this was questioned in my mind.

Also, when I was a boy from six to 12 years old, my nickname was Question Box. And most people did not know my given name other than Question Box because I wanted to know the answer to so many things and give you an example.

I wanted to know if we ate chicken, why didn't we didn't grow feathers on us. And if we ate beef, why we didn't have, horns and a tail? And nobody could answer my question. I mean, this thing is really was really a perplexing question to me.

It wasn't that I was trying to be silly or foolish. I really wanted to know the answer and and and and a thousand of other questions. I had I was an eternal kid asking questions. And one question I asked was, when you set out sweet potatoes, why do you cut them early in the morning, throw them out in the sun all day, and let the vines wilt, and then stick them in the ground late in the afternoon? Why don't you set them out whenever they're fresh and tender? Well, when I got to be a man, I set them out when they were fresh and tender.

You know what happened? They all rotted off at the ground. So I had to throw them out and let them wilt, but nobody could answer my question. This the only answer I got, well, that's the way my daddy did it, and that's way his daddy did it, and that's way his daddy did it.

And, you know, most farmers today are about forty years behind in progressive scientific practices. We have not turned loose the old. We did not dare to try the new, and we expect these things to just turn out of luck.

And today, if you take the gamble out of farmers, most farmers would quit. They love the gamble of it more than they really love the progressive accuracy of it. Well, we can be a lot more accurate. Now back to the atom.

Well, there had to be a difference somewhere. But I was taught that in an atom, there was the there was the same number of protons as neutrons. Well, I was also taught in college by the university that negatives attract positives, that opposites opposites attract each other.

But yet there was mayor's law, there was Barnes law, there was famous law, all saying that light things attract each other, which was the conclusion of these laws, one dealing with solids, one dealing with gases, and one dealing with solids and gases. All of them ended with a conclusion that light things attract each other.

Well, if light things attract each other, how is it that opposites attract each other? Well, I didn't find the answer, but I wasn't satisfied. So in my research, I came up with these facts and they can be proven that there is not the same number of protons and neutrons.

Because if you did, everything would have the same specific gravity and everything would revert back to the line of least resistance or the ratio of one to one and dehydrogen. That's just common sense. As a fourth grader, you could think that one out.

Now, I did learn to find out why. Atoms are made up of anions and cations, but how many and how much? Well, an anion is the smallest thing that God ever made, and it's singular. And they're always in their singular.

They're never in their plural. But and and but and they're so small, you cannot cut one in two. You cannot divide it. You cannot take it apart. It comes as a whole. Yep. Recall one anion, the 499 anions, an anion.

We still consider it an anion. Now you you it's like putting a a container here with marbles in it. You don't take the marbles apart, but you can take out some other marbles. Now one marble would represent one millhouse unit of energy.

One marble would represent of the power of an anion is from one to 499 millhouse units of energy. A single cat ion contains 500 millhouse units of energy. It's just a little bit bigger marble. In other words, at the same temperature and pressure, it would be 500 times larger than a single anion would be the size of one cation.

Now, the cat iron millhouse units of energy are from 500 to nine ninety nine millhouse units of energy. Now you're going need this when you get into the feed this week, feeding of animals and the growth of animals.

You're going to need this information. We're just going to let you dig through the tee hole out of this week, though. And if you need to know more about it and have not taken the agricultural course, then come and get that because the progress of the farm begins in the field, not in the barn.

Also, it's called one millhouse unit, whether it has 500 millhouse units or nine ninety nine, it's still considered one millhouse unit and discussing it. There again, you just got a bigger marble. You can't divide the marbles.

But you can divide the strength of your millhouse units, but you're not dividing any single millhouse unit, whether it is a cationic or anionic. Now the anionic is the negative or the alkali and the cationic is the positive.

Also, the anionic is the negative and the cationic is the positive. There is the positive. So in this, in this, we will find the secret of the atom. Now, an atom, you have two kinds of atoms. You have the negative and the positive atoms.

And some of the things I'm going to tell you here in the class is going to be exactly opposite from what you've learned in college. Well, all I say is don't believe a word I say, go prove me wrong. Go out and prove me wrong because I have already worked with it fifty years in a laboratory and I find that it works whether I understand it or not.

And this is the way I explain what appears to me to be the truth. For instance, an atom hydrogen has one negative and one positive or one anion and one cation in its singular form and its smallest existence of an atom of hydrogen, one to one.

So that is why we compare all pH readings to hydrogen because it's the simple atom. It's the simplest form. So we compare our pH ratios to a hydrogen atom. A carbon atom is always positive. The anions are on the inside and the cations are the electrons on the outside.

Also, in the positives, in a positive substance, the electron travels counterclockwise when you're looking directly at the spectrum of the atom. And a negative or an anionic travels clockwise and that's the way energy is created, by the resistance.

Now here's the key. Between the resistance between anions and cations with different millhouse units of power versus cations with different millhouse units of power versus anions and calions. So there you have the three forces and three ways by which all energy is made.

Now what's so important about that when you go feed it? Are you going to feed a cow or a horse or a chicken or yourself or your family? Well, that is the principle. That is the biological law by which life exists.

Mr. Einstein taught us how to move an object from A to B in the same direction or from A back to A if you go far enough. But he did not teach us how to move it from B back to A regardless of the distance.

So in the biological realm and in the silver plating, nickel plating, chromium plating realm, it can be done. Otherwise, your atoms become actually unharnessed, uncompleted. But in this other realm, one in the realm of E mc2, there's only a loss of energy.

But in the other two forms that we give in the class of agriculture, you have a gain of energy, collective energy. If that wasn't true, nothing would grow. There would be no sizes. Everything would be Well, actually there wouldn't be any life upon this planet.

There's one more thought I want to bring to you in this regard and that is the colloidal elements. The colloidal elements are the, there's two kinds of colloids. One kind of colloid is measurement of size measured in millions of microns.

The other one is a measure of a compound that each mouth contains all elements within that compound and cannot be taken apart. There always were just so many of them and no more. They cannot be created or made only by God himself in the beginning.

About 3% of our bone is a colloidal substance. And that is what makes our teeth and our bones. And also the fiber of plants is largely made up or mineralized by colloidal particles. Remember, here's another law of physics that I'm going to give you and don't you forget it.

Don't forget it. 80% of all the food for animals and plants comes from the air. They only get 20% through the mouth of what they 80% comes from the air. We're going to go into that more a little later in the class.

But remember that 80%, so therefore we can conclude that we do not live off of the food we eat. We live off of the energy from the food we eat. Now back to the colloid. The colloid in nature is what the jewel is to the watch.

It's 100% available. It does not have to be digested. As such, it is never a part of the soul of the plant or the person or the animal. It is a part of the energy that can be lost and therefore taken up to be used by another plant or animal or person.

So these are factors that you're going to need to know. Now, another factor that bothered me as a boy was it began when I was five years old. A minister, circuit rider minister who came around once a month preached on the resurrection of the dead, but he went home with my parents that day.

And that while we were having dinner, I said to him, I don't believe what you said today, preacher. And my father and mother's face all clouded up. I knew I'd said something wrong, but just being a little boy, didn't know what it was.

He said, what did I say that you did not understand? I said, well, you said that when people die, they go to the grave and when Jesus comes, he's going to open the graves and take them to heaven with them. And don't you know when people die or when things die, they go to dust and you can't put them together again? You say, well, you're just a child now.

But when you're a man, you'll understand these things. Well, I didn't understand them. The martyrs burned at the stake. The people buried at sea, eaten by the fishes and scattered all over the earth, it became almost an impossibility to me.

I did not understand it. It was a massive confusion of impossibility. My problem was I was trying to bring God down to my size. But in 1934, a couple of police officers brought into my laboratory some answers from a building that was burned and said, can you tell us whether this was an animal or a person that was burned in this building.

The undertaker had been a lifelong friend of my father. About my father's age, he had a crematory, and I borrowed ashes from him, and I determined that people live on frequencies and I determined the frequency.

And in those ashes, there were not one person, there was three people because their frequency was the same, but there was three different micrologists and the middle mycrologists denoted that there were black people. And when I gave this report to the police department, they said there was a woman, colored woman, who was in colored town, this building burned, and her son and daughter were missing.

I could not tell anything about the age, but my description was close enough that it became a closed case of that. So I learned the frequency upon which people live and I was already doing research upon plants on the frequency they live and animals on the frequency they live.

And Doctor. Northrop of Germany taught me the frequency of grapes. But he didn't exactly explain all to me in his broken German that I didn't very well understand all the details of his experiment, but he did teach me the frequency of grapes.

Now, once you know the frequency, then you know the diet. That's just a matter of mathematical calculation. And also the frequency of cattle, just take cattle, deer, buffalo, moose, elk, it was all the same.

They're all on the same frequency. But all varieties of sheep is on a different one and goats another. All variety of hogs, regardless of what you might call them, are on the same frequency. Whether they're wild or tame, it doesn't make any difference.

But the macronage determines the species. That separates the species. But in human beings, we don't think of species, but yet we think of differences. And the determines the color. The millimicronage is the path of the electron in orbit that determines the color because of the prism of light.

Now all this has a lot to do with feeding an animal. Do you know that anything with a yellow color to it has more vitamin A in it than other things it doesn't have? Like carrots, yellow corn has more vitamin A in it than white corn.

Well, white corn on the same soil, generally if there's enough calcium in the soil, will have more carbohydrate in it. So that's why people grow white corn to eat and yellow corn to feed their animals. Also, yellow corn, the grains shrink up a little bit more.

It doesn't carry the high carbon content. Therefore, the volume will weigh a pound or two more per bushel, but yet be more deficient in mineral in that bushel than the bushel of yellow corn. Now that's the only exception, just about that I know, where there can be a small deficiency in mineral and an increase in weight.

But most of the time, any increase in weight and carbohydrates means an increase carbohydrate. An increase in carbohydrate generally means an increase in our weight. Now, if you bring your yellow corn to the maximum of its carbohydrate and the same percentage, then it will weigh less than the white corn.

Now also remember, I'm speaking at the same percent of moisture. Please, I forgot to tell you. I'm talking about at the same percent of moisture. However, the white corn at 40% moisture will be about as dry as yellow corn is at 18% or 14% moisture and it will keep much better.

And offered to an animal, they will always take the one that's highest in carbohydrate. Now they don't know anything about laboratory experiments but they can smell the sugar in whatever you're offering them to eat and that's what they will govern their choice of food by.

So in the last few years and people, come up with kinesiology. Well, that's what an animal uses with his nose to tell which is best without using the kinesiology. So whenever we begin to offer food to animals now, many times in your young stock, not much for chicken, but for young animals, young horses, horses are especially sensitive, When they're not doing so well, if you can give them a choice of food, they will correct their own diet.

But when there is no choice, they cannot correct their own diet. They cannot change it and therefore they have to take what they can get. Also, when animals are ill, if they are in open range, will generally go out and eat the herb that they need to get them well again.

But in pens, they cannot do that. There needs to be a lot of research done more on various herbs and plants with animals with certain symptoms in order to find a simple organic natural way of getting them well.

When I grew up with animals, my father had approximately 200 head of cattle. I can't ever remember him having at any time a veterinarian out to any of the cattle because they were in open range. I do remember him having them out once or twice to horses, but they died anyway.

So it didn't make a lot of difference. He had the funeral and the vet bill to pay. But then at that time vets had very little to deal with as compared with what they had today. In later years, my father told me that in his opinion that the animals had been poisoned because of somebody's jealousy.

In other words, someone get mad with you about something, and probably you didn't even know they were mad. Then someone went to an arsenic in your horse trough, and three days later, you had a dead horse or a dead new dead cow.

And all of them died very similar, so it was impossible for a vet to save them anyway. But I'm not casting any reflection on vets. Was just telling you what happened when animals have an open range. Today it's impossible to have an open range, so we're going to have to try to find ways and means to solve our problems within the means of what we have.

And where do you think the problem of farming starts today? I'm going to ask the class this question. Where does the problem of farming begin today? Yes. In the soil. In the soil. That's right. It absolutely begins in the soil.

Right in the soil. Now, if it begins in the soil, I am to ask you another question. Why is it that only one animal will get sick and all the rest of them won't? Or why is it that two percent or five percent get sick and all of them got the same thing? Why is it that just one animal will get sick and all have the same treatment? Can't anybody answer that question? What's that? They're all different.

They're all different, but there's one thing that's different about them, and what is that? I forgot what I told you five minutes ago. What is different about them? The micronage is different. Right? So a slight difference in the micronage down to the millimicronage.

It's actually the millimetomicronage that is different. That's my joke. It's the millimetomicrons that's different. So there's a genetic difference. So therefore, they're going to need a mineral that is different.

Now where and what element does this deficiency first begin in this animal? What one element does it first begin that they get out of the field? What element? Calcium. Calcium, right. Why is calcium so vastly important in an animal, in our food? Why is it so important? And make 60% of the driveway, yes, up to 80%.

Yeah. But there's another reason why. The what is the primary reason? The way the vitamins are most needed. It's where vitamins are most needed, but what manufactures the vitamins? The liver manufactures the vitamins.

That's right. What is the substance of that animals and people's liver manufactures? What's the name of it? Bile. What is bile? Bile is a dilute form of hydrochloric acid. Well, is hydrochloric acid a base or an acid? Is it? I know what the book says, but is it? Don't you know? It is a base.

Hydrochloric acid is a base. Well, for instance, if you dilute hydrochloric acid with distilled water and it's a base, the water being a neutral, then the hydrochloric had to be a base. How do you tell a base from an acid? What distinguishes the difference between a base and an acid? The direction of the rotation of the electron in orbit.

That makes the difference. Now, what determines frequency? Yes, the number, how many times, but what goes around? What determines frequency? Your synchronization point. Your synchronization point determines the frequency.

Is there anything hard about this? Isn't it easy? Well, for instance, if you took sulfuric acid, mixed it with water, what happens? It heats up, doesn't it? And if you have equal amounts by weight, you have hydrogen peroxide, two h two o. Right? So whenever the hydrogen peroxide isn't hot, is it? It has a temperature of the room in which it is.

So that is the synchronization point. At the point that they blend perfectly. At the blending point. I'll say it that way. It's the point at which they blend until there's no more resistance. Now when God made the kinds, he made them on frequencies.

It sounds like I'm back in devotion again, but actually it's it's facts. He made them each according to his own kind, and he told them to go and multiply. Each according to their own frequency, they produced their own kinds.

Now who was the first man that learned something about animal husbandry, the effects of breeding animals, who was the first man that learned? Jacob. What did he learn? Speckled calves. That's right. He got speckled calves.

So therefore, he castrated all the solid kind of the bulls and only used the speckled kind and beat his father as one Jew beating another Jew at his own game because he didn't know anything about Isaac didn't know anything about the breeding of animals, but Jacob did. Was, just as a matter of interest, was Jacob's first wife's name? Leah.

That's right. What was his second wife? How many years did he work for her? Fourteen. Well, I imagine that he paid for her on an installment plan. I don't imagine he had to wait fourteen years to get it. He bought it and paid it for an installment plan until he got it.

These are just interesting facts to kind of wet your mind off of this math for a moment. And now we'll get back to the math. Now what is the frequency of a of a a horse? Can anybody tell me? I'm sorry? 44 for a stunt and 46 for a male.

That's right. What is the frequency of a dog of dogs, wolves, coyotes? Thirty eight and forty. That's correct. Now how many decimals? Four decimals. How many decimals does human beings have? And what's the frequency of human beings? Twenty four and twenty six.

Aren't you glad there's a difference? Well, you see, this is putting things down to where you can handle them and you know what to do about it. Now, if you have any thing with four decimals, it does not require cooked food for its existence.

Now isn't that easy? It can live off of natural foods. Now any human being that tries to live off of uncooked foods is trying to be an animal. And it won't be long before they look like one. You know, I heard it said that they could feed any jackass on raw food.

Well, so if you can't take your problem and smile about them, it gets you down. Your B3 will get too short or you'll lose the ability to smile. Let me ask how many of you farmers, I want to see your hands on this, both men and women, sing while you work.

Hold up your hand. Yeah. Whistle counts. Well, that's pretty good. That's above the average. You got above that. Most of them don't. Well, why don't you sing? Why don't people sing more? Why don't you sing? Do you ever did you ever stop to analyze why you don't sing? You're unhappy.

Happy people sing. So you're unhappy. Well, why are you unhappy? Figure that one out yourself. You don't have to answer in your class. But this is coming down to the base of your problem. In other words, what I am trying to get you to do right now at this time is to learn to define your problem and know what your problem is.

If you don't know what your problem is, there's no way to solve it. There's no way to solve it unless you bound your problem. But once your problem is bounded, then you can start to work on it. And if you're too lazy to think, well, hire somebody to think for you that does not have a product to sell.

If they got a product to sell and you've got a problem run for your life. Okay? Now, some of you may have products to sell. Well, God bless you. But try to help the farmer in such a way that he can buy more of it instead of less of it each year.

In other words, his ability to purchase your product depends on his net profit. So try to help him make a profit first and get yours second, because that's the way to do it. If you really know what you're doing, quit selling any product and get out and sell a service, sell a service without anything attached.

And you will find that if you turn out the goods that you will have more work than any one human being can ever do in their life. Now, also, when you know you know, then you can when you know you know, you should know what you're worth.


## Full Transcript

*Complete transcription without speaker identification:*

I'd like to welcome all of you to a course that I have not had, so we're all gonna be together. And, this is a totally new avenue of this continuing series of the biological theory of ionization. And, the reason I'm having is of course he's told me enough things and he's taken my great matter that he told me if I had a course he'd finish.

So I'm waiting for the finish and a lot of things he's told me. And, so we got kind of an outline I'm gonna have typed up here and we'll pass out and what he's gonna kinda cover. And then, tonight and tomorrow night, I'll have about, an hour and a half, two hours of, one of the things I wanna cover real thoroughly with is what are dairy calves, calf problems, scours, calve problems, and this type of thing.

I'm real fortunate in this area. Have 3,000 pale calves that are shipped in here every winter and I get a pretty good education. I keep them alive and you soon find out there's some you cannot keep alive and I'll tell you why.

And so I'll be covering some of that and Doctor. Eames will be going into his aspects from biological theory of ionization. Both of you who have had the soils course, he'll be relating that to the how it affects the animal in quite a little detail and also give you some tips and things that we can do in the interim here.

But the one thing I want you to do and remember when he's lecturing and this type of thing is that Doctor. Reams thinks the mathematics and for some of you that may be hard to understand. When he gets a thought pattern going, for the benefit of most of us in the room, is try to refrain from your questions until that thought pattern is done because otherwise he gets off at it and hard for him to get back on a specific pattern.

Now we're not trying to discourage questions. Don't get me wrong. But there is times that it's easier for him to let him finish that and then come back with a question. Now when a question comes up under that kind of a circumstance, it'd be best if you could write it down and it would help you greatly.

Then we can pick them up at a at a different time, but I think this would be the most helpful from that standpoint when these things do come to mind. Now a few other things, the, there will be cassette tapes taped here and we'll try to get the questions and the answers as best we can.

I realize the time seems going with it doesn't always happen, but we'll try to try to do it and if you catch this, we're not doing it often, get after us about it because we get going on up here and and sometimes we slip up on that. The tapes that I have, they're a sixty minute tape.

I buy the the highest quality tape I can buy. They're not cheap tape and, they're $4 apiece from up here. You're welcome to go ahead and record them yourself. I've always said in these courses, as long as it doesn't interfere and make a lot of commotion and noise.

Now try to use your best discretion, please, on that. And on Wednesday night, we're gonna have a banquet. When doctor reams teaches courses, this thing, he likes to have a banquet. So that'll be on Wednesday night.

Just come and we'll announce that later anyway. There's no charge for that. That'll be with the course here. So with that, my, doctor Rings will start. And each morning, he likes to have a short devotional, and then we'll go on.

Doctor. Still getting a buzz in this thing. Does it make a difference? Yeah. She's clear. Okay. That's what it is. That's the one of them spliced ones in. Suppose. So that's alright. The one might go work. Just as long as you can hear it on there and there's no one beating, you're alright.

Okay. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good This morning, in our morning devotion, we're gonna talk to you about a book. The first thought comes in your mind is the bible. Well, that's one book, but there's a lot of others.

And most of you most of you fellows were born in with television brought up with it. Well, when I was born, we didn't have television, and we had more time for books. And we didn't watch television so much, and we had more time to watch the girls.

Youth is youth at any time. Not a lot of difference in our ways, but there is difference in our way we plan our time. And the Bible is a book that limits, that is limited by time. In other words, it really begins with time and ends with time, but the thoughts in it lead us to a perpetual destiny, not the book itself, but the thoughts that are in it that we can make a part of ourselves.

If every one of us or each one of us was limited by a book, progress would almost cease. It's only that effort or only that, actually, wisdom that you use beyond the knowledge of the book that really counts.

If you're just going to be a teacher, go buy the book. But if you're going to be a progressive farmer, then go beyond the book. Along about nineteen thirty seven at 02:00 in the morning, I got a call to a poultry farm about 40 miles away.

And I went out to this poultry farm and got there about 04:00. And this man had been in the candy business all the days of his life, and he was up in his early seventies. And he had gone in the poultry business, and the most up to date standard poultry farm, I guess, the state.

He had conveyor belts for feed, conveyor belts for taking out the manures, and it was it was really a fabulous soldier on the bottlers as what he was going to produce. And he had 75,000 baby chicks come in the same day and 25,000 turkeys.

And him, brand new, never raised a chicken in his life. And three days later, it was a February morning, the humidity dropped and the temperature was 85 in the poultry houses, and the chicks were dying by the bucketfuls.

And when I got there, there was a pile of baby chicks like you can't believe in baby turkeys. We had two or three colored men going through, picking out the dead ones, and the chicks were all huddled in one corner, making a noise as if they were cold.

We had two feed men out there and one man from the university who lived near there who was supposed to be a specialist in poultry, I've been there since about 10:00 that night. The specialist in poultry from the university.

Well, when I got out there, he they said they told me that the chicks were poisoning poisoned on something and to bring my emergency kit for poisoning. I brought it already, but I walked down through the poultry houses from end to end and looked at them.

And the first question I asked is where where I couldn't see any thermostats in the building. So I said, where are your thermostats? And I was in the building outside where you could set at one place, set the thermostat in any building.

So they took me out to where the thermostats were, and I turned each one of them up to 100. They said, you're going to cook these chickens. I said, you can't eat them raw. Well, that was a case that the humidity had dropped and the chicks were freezing to death at 85 degrees.

And in in two hours, I said, well, aren't you gonna test the water in the field? I said, no. You call me out here to fix it. I've already fixed it. And I said in two hours, there won't be any more chicks dying, and there were not.

They said, well, there's nothing in the book about that. I said, if they had, you wouldn't have called me, but I'll guarantee you this. It would be tomorrow. It'll be in the book tomorrow. So this is what I'm telling you.

Go beyond the book. Dare to go beyond the book. Use that head. There's a knot on everybody's shoulder here, and in it, there's supposed to be some brains, and use them. Go beyond the book. Don't try to be limited by the book unless you're a professor, and then present more than one way of doing, I think.

When I was in college, I only presented one way to do it. I've spent fifty years in research, and I found there's many ways to prosperity and also to this poor house. Go buy, your problems. In other words, you don't need a book till you have a problem.

And then you need to refresh your memory on what has been done on or about that problem. And if none of the things has been done on that problem, then do the next best thing. And that then is beginning to solve your problem as to go beyond the book.

Now, where do you start when you when you go beyond the book? And that is to see everything you look at. You know, most people go through life and they see very little. In the agricultural class, I asked the class how many people knew which way the seed in a watermelon pointed to the rind or to the heart.

And you know most I think there's only two or three in a class that do. They don't see everything you look at. Pay close attention to everything you see. Register it in your mind, and then you can begin to collect points in solving your problem.

But one thing I advise you never to do is never to take your problems to bed with you unless it's just a female. Don't take your farm problems to bed with you. Your domestic problem, yes. So in this week, we're going to learn things that are not in the book.

And you're going to also learn that the books are for one purpose, and that is to get you to thinking. Now if you were in a mechanical school, then you would go by the book, but you're not dealing with a a mechanical object.

You are dealing with a biological life where there isn't any real pattern of perfection as far as putting or taking apart the parts. Like an automobile, There's no car to keys. There's no nuts except the one that's trying to solve the problem.

And it can be a part of the answer instead of a part of the problem. The farmer tomorrow of tomorrow and the minister of the gospel of tomorrow that is most successful is going to be the one that does their own thinking, collects their own prejudices, and sets a precedent for themselves and keep their mouths shut about how they made their progress because you will find the thing that worked for you does not work for your neighbor always.

They'll be or sometimes it does once in a while. Down in Georgia, there was Jed a friend called up his friend Jed and said, Jed said, when your mule was set, what did you do for him? Jed said, I gave him a quart of turpentine.

So Jed met him on the street on Saturday night, and said, well, I said, how's your view? He said that that quart of turpentine killed him. Jed said it killed my viewer too. So sometimes with your remedies, need to find out what the result is before you apply the remedy.

So what I'm trying to say is let's put some hoarse sense behind our farming, behind our practices, behind our religion, and works. Now in regard to our morning devotion this morning, I'm gonna leave you one main thought.

I find when I leave over three, you forget all of them. But if I just leave you one or two, you'll remember them and can take them home with you. And that is that duty to God or service to God begins where duty ends.

Service to God begins where duty ends. Don't forget that. Because long as you're doing your duty, that's not service for God. So you must go beyond duty in order to be of value. And it's only that part of your life that you go beyond duty that pays high dividends.

And I tell you how high it will pay. Then your paycheck becomes or your net profit becomes God's report card. When we're in school, we work for a grade. But when we're in life, we work for remuneration of some kind.

But then your paycheck is God's report card, how well pleased he is with you. I'm gonna give you a verse of scripture now for my second thought in the scripture this morning. And that this one you will find in the Amos, the book of Amos, the third chapter and seventh verse.

In the King James version, it says this, I will not the Lord is speaking to Amos, and he said this, I will not do anything except that which I will reveal to my to my prophets. And some of the translations is italics if they ask me, which is understood without the italics.

So one of the things to do in farming when all biological life is depending upon God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit Communication with you is to ask him what you don't know the answer to. That's where I got my answers.

And I don't have them all. I just have a few of them that works. And we're gonna learn about those answers or some of those things this week. But go beyond the book. Even in your spiritual life, go beyond the book.

Go to the point that when Jesus said, my sheep know my voice, go until you hear his voice. In order to hear his voice, you're gonna have to turn off the television for a few hours in the radio or the of the tractor.

You're gonna have to listen. And there's no time better in life to listen than in the night when you are awake. And the more awake you are at night, the healthier you are. You don't need the rest. No one has ever died from lack of sleep, but the cemetery is full of people who died from worrying about it.

When you're ill and sick or if you're if you're dead tired at night if you're dead tired at night, you're sick. But if you got a lot of energy in the evening, your reserve energy is higher. So take care of your health, and then you can think straight.

Sick people can't think straight. So then also you're going to find it's the same thing in biological life that keeps you thinking straight And all of and as well as theological life, you've got to be able to have the right foods to think straight.

I believe, thoroughly believe, that the farmers of tomorrow can be our nation's finest doctors and that many of them will be if they produce a high quality food and they know what they have and they know how to market it. And that's what we're going to study about this week is how to have a higher quality food at lower cost per package and get a premium price in the market.

I'll give you an example. Right now in Boston, we are paying up to 50¢ apiece for little grapefruit. And the farmer in Florida is getting a dollar for two bushels, a 100 grade food. Just think of that. Just think of it.

Well, there's a lot of there's there's too much loss between the farmer and the retail market. Now a year ago in Boston, well, about over The United States, we were paying $7, well, $7.50 to $8 at this time of year, January.

For lemons, we're paying $22.50 now for the same box of lemons, not because they had a short crop, but because a lot of people are drinking lemonade. A lot of people have become more in demand, and there are gonna be more more demand.

So supply and demand is what causes prices to go up. But, also, remember this, that the market has never been flooded with top quality produce. There's always a great demand for top quality produce. And you know the church has never been flooded with real saints of God.

Real saints of God that's whose faith whose faith is backed up by works. Faith without works is dead, and by their fruits ye shall know them. A saint of God is a peculiar person. In that, it is impossible to insult one.

They're insult proof. They are so busy attending to God's business until they don't have time to attend to the neighbor's business. And consequently, they have a good report card and have a good paycheck.

Also, the person that's so busy in the churches tending to other people's business don't have very much fruit and they criticize everybody else's. But remember this, as farmers, as men in a community, as a part of our government, it's a lot it takes a lot less energy to push anyone up than it does to push them down.

Because when you push them down, they're going to resist it. And I've never seen a man resist being pushed up. And, also, it takes twice as much energy to get up after you've gone down with them as it were to push them up in the first place.

So us conserve our energy. Everything we say, everything we do depends on energy of some kind. Our lives as what we are depends on spiritual energy. Our progress in the farm depends on spiritual energy. The crop grows on on life given from God.

You can't put life in a seed. You can't put life in a hill of grass. You can't put life in a hill of corn, but God can. So start giving him the credit. And believe me, he'll give you the cash. Is now a fair exchange? This is my morning devotion to you this morning.

I'm going to ask that you think much upon it, take it home with you what you can, and use it for the glory of God. Father, we thank you this morning for this time in this morning devotion. We thank you for the opportunity of coming before these and share the wisdom that you have given to us.

There are many new thoughts, many new ways, many new ideas, as much progress at hand as has not been used, and may each of us go home a little better prepared to handle the problems that you have given us to strengthen our faith than we than we find ourselves when we first come here. Answer this prayer, dear father, and we will give you the praise throughout eternity.

Open our minds today as have never been opened, and touch us by thy holy spirit, father, as we've never been touched. And teach us how dependent we are upon thee, I will thank you forever and ever, perpetually.

Amen. So how many of you are attending this class any or the class that I have taught or doctor Stiles taught for the because not for the first time, one that either one of us has never taught, how many of you are new new in this class? Hold up your hands.

Okay. There's quite a few. For your if you for the old ones that's here, they has had some of the teaching, I wanna give a very few minutes with you on energy. Everything that moves, moves on energy. And when I went to college, an atom was thought to be the smallest thing that there was because that is the smallest division of an element.

An atom is the smallest way that an atom can be divided. But the thought came to me, if an atom was the smallest thing that that there is, why aren't all atoms alike? Why is one silver? Why is one gold? Why is one carbon? Why is one hydrogen? Why is one nitrogen? And all this was questioned in my mind.

Also, when I was a boy from six to 12 years old, my nickname was Question Box. And most people did not know my given name other than Question Box because I wanted to know the answer to so many things and give you an example.

I wanted to know if we ate chicken, why didn't we didn't grow feathers on us. And if we ate beef, why we didn't have, horns and a tail? And nobody could answer my question. I mean, this thing is really was really a perplexing question to me.

It wasn't that I was trying to be silly or foolish. I really wanted to know the answer and and and and a thousand of other questions. I had I was an eternal kid asking questions. And one question I asked was, when you set out sweet potatoes, why do you cut them early in the morning, throw them out in the sun all day, and let the vines wilt, and then stick them in the ground late in the afternoon? Why don't you set them out whenever they're fresh and tender? Well, when I got to be a man, I set them out when they were fresh and tender.

You know what happened? They all rotted off at the ground. So I had to throw them out and let them wilt, but nobody could answer my question. This the only answer I got, well, that's the way my daddy did it, and that's way his daddy did it, and that's way his daddy did it.

And, you know, most farmers today are about forty years behind in progressive scientific practices. We have not turned loose the old. We did not dare to try the new, and we expect these things to just turn out of luck.

And today, if you take the gamble out of farmers, most farmers would quit. They love the gamble of it more than they really love the progressive accuracy of it. Well, we can be a lot more accurate. Now back to the atom.

Well, there had to be a difference somewhere. But I was taught that in an atom, there was the there was the same number of protons as neutrons. Well, I was also taught in college by the university that negatives attract positives, that opposites opposites attract each other.

But yet there was mayor's law, there was Barnes law, there was famous law, all saying that light things attract each other, which was the conclusion of these laws, one dealing with solids, one dealing with gases, and one dealing with solids and gases. All of them ended with a conclusion that light things attract each other.

Well, if light things attract each other, how is it that opposites attract each other? Well, I didn't find the answer, but I wasn't satisfied. So in my research, I came up with these facts and they can be proven that there is not the same number of protons and neutrons.

Because if you did, everything would have the same specific gravity and everything would revert back to the line of least resistance or the ratio of one to one and dehydrogen. That's just common sense. As a fourth grader, you could think that one out.

Now, I did learn to find out why. Atoms are made up of anions and cations, but how many and how much? Well, an anion is the smallest thing that God ever made, and it's singular. And they're always in their singular.

They're never in their plural. But and and but and they're so small, you cannot cut one in two. You cannot divide it. You cannot take it apart. It comes as a whole. Yep. Recall one anion, the 499 anions, an anion.

We still consider it an anion. Now you you it's like putting a a container here with marbles in it. You don't take the marbles apart, but you can take out some other marbles. Now one marble would represent one millhouse unit of energy.

One marble would represent of the power of an anion is from one to 499 millhouse units of energy. A single cat ion contains 500 millhouse units of energy. It's just a little bit bigger marble. In other words, at the same temperature and pressure, it would be 500 times larger than a single anion would be the size of one cation.

Now, the cat iron millhouse units of energy are from 500 to nine ninety nine millhouse units of energy. Now you're going need this when you get into the feed this week, feeding of animals and the growth of animals.

You're going to need this information. We're just going to let you dig through the tee hole out of this week, though. And if you need to know more about it and have not taken the agricultural course, then come and get that because the progress of the farm begins in the field, not in the barn.

Also, it's called one millhouse unit, whether it has 500 millhouse units or nine ninety nine, it's still considered one millhouse unit and discussing it. There again, you just got a bigger marble. You can't divide the marbles.

But you can divide the strength of your millhouse units, but you're not dividing any single millhouse unit, whether it is a cationic or anionic. Now the anionic is the negative or the alkali and the cationic is the positive.

Also, the anionic is the negative and the cationic is the positive. There is the positive. So in this, in this, we will find the secret of the atom. Now, an atom, you have two kinds of atoms. You have the negative and the positive atoms.

And some of the things I'm going to tell you here in the class is going to be exactly opposite from what you've learned in college. Well, all I say is don't believe a word I say, go prove me wrong. Go out and prove me wrong because I have already worked with it fifty years in a laboratory and I find that it works whether I understand it or not.

And this is the way I explain what appears to me to be the truth. For instance, an atom hydrogen has one negative and one positive or one anion and one cation in its singular form and its smallest existence of an atom of hydrogen, one to one.

So that is why we compare all pH readings to hydrogen because it's the simple atom. It's the simplest form. So we compare our pH ratios to a hydrogen atom. A carbon atom is always positive. The anions are on the inside and the cations are the electrons on the outside.

Also, in the positives, in a positive substance, the electron travels counterclockwise when you're looking directly at the spectrum of the atom. And a negative or an anionic travels clockwise and that's the way energy is created, by the resistance.

Now here's the key. Between the resistance between anions and cations with different millhouse units of power versus cations with different millhouse units of power versus anions and calions. So there you have the three forces and three ways by which all energy is made.

Now what's so important about that when you go feed it? Are you going to feed a cow or a horse or a chicken or yourself or your family? Well, that is the principle. That is the biological law by which life exists.

Mr. Einstein taught us how to move an object from A to B in the same direction or from A back to A if you go far enough. But he did not teach us how to move it from B back to A regardless of the distance.

So in the biological realm and in the silver plating, nickel plating, chromium plating realm, it can be done. Otherwise, your atoms become actually unharnessed, uncompleted. But in this other realm, one in the realm of E mc2, there's only a loss of energy.

But in the other two forms that we give in the class of agriculture, you have a gain of energy, collective energy. If that wasn't true, nothing would grow. There would be no sizes. Everything would be Well, actually there wouldn't be any life upon this planet.

There's one more thought I want to bring to you in this regard and that is the colloidal elements. The colloidal elements are the, there's two kinds of colloids. One kind of colloid is measurement of size measured in millions of microns.

The other one is a measure of a compound that each mouth contains all elements within that compound and cannot be taken apart. There always were just so many of them and no more. They cannot be created or made only by God himself in the beginning.

About 3% of our bone is a colloidal substance. And that is what makes our teeth and our bones. And also the fiber of plants is largely made up or mineralized by colloidal particles. Remember, here's another law of physics that I'm going to give you and don't you forget it.

Don't forget it. 80% of all the food for animals and plants comes from the air. They only get 20% through the mouth of what they 80% comes from the air. We're going to go into that more a little later in the class.

But remember that 80%, so therefore we can conclude that we do not live off of the food we eat. We live off of the energy from the food we eat. Now back to the colloid. The colloid in nature is what the jewel is to the watch.

It's 100% available. It does not have to be digested. As such, it is never a part of the soul of the plant or the person or the animal. It is a part of the energy that can be lost and therefore taken up to be used by another plant or animal or person.

So these are factors that you're going to need to know. Now, another factor that bothered me as a boy was it began when I was five years old. A minister, circuit rider minister who came around once a month preached on the resurrection of the dead, but he went home with my parents that day.

And that while we were having dinner, I said to him, I don't believe what you said today, preacher. And my father and mother's face all clouded up. I knew I'd said something wrong, but just being a little boy, didn't know what it was.

He said, what did I say that you did not understand? I said, well, you said that when people die, they go to the grave and when Jesus comes, he's going to open the graves and take them to heaven with them. And don't you know when people die or when things die, they go to dust and you can't put them together again? You say, well, you're just a child now.

But when you're a man, you'll understand these things. Well, I didn't understand them. The martyrs burned at the stake. The people buried at sea, eaten by the fishes and scattered all over the earth, it became almost an impossibility to me.

I did not understand it. It was a massive confusion of impossibility. My problem was I was trying to bring God down to my size. But in 1934, a couple of police officers brought into my laboratory some answers from a building that was burned and said, can you tell us whether this was an animal or a person that was burned in this building.

The undertaker had been a lifelong friend of my father. About my father's age, he had a crematory, and I borrowed ashes from him, and I determined that people live on frequencies and I determined the frequency.

And in those ashes, there were not one person, there was three people because their frequency was the same, but there was three different micrologists and the middle mycrologists denoted that there were black people. And when I gave this report to the police department, they said there was a woman, colored woman, who was in colored town, this building burned, and her son and daughter were missing.

I could not tell anything about the age, but my description was close enough that it became a closed case of that. So I learned the frequency upon which people live and I was already doing research upon plants on the frequency they live and animals on the frequency they live.

And Doctor. Northrop of Germany taught me the frequency of grapes. But he didn't exactly explain all to me in his broken German that I didn't very well understand all the details of his experiment, but he did teach me the frequency of grapes.

Now, once you know the frequency, then you know the diet. That's just a matter of mathematical calculation. And also the frequency of cattle, just take cattle, deer, buffalo, moose, elk, it was all the same.

They're all on the same frequency. But all varieties of sheep is on a different one and goats another. All variety of hogs, regardless of what you might call them, are on the same frequency. Whether they're wild or tame, it doesn't make any difference.

But the macronage determines the species. That separates the species. But in human beings, we don't think of species, but yet we think of differences. And the determines the color. The millimicronage is the path of the electron in orbit that determines the color because of the prism of light.

Now all this has a lot to do with feeding an animal. Do you know that anything with a yellow color to it has more vitamin A in it than other things it doesn't have? Like carrots, yellow corn has more vitamin A in it than white corn.

Well, white corn on the same soil, generally if there's enough calcium in the soil, will have more carbohydrate in it. So that's why people grow white corn to eat and yellow corn to feed their animals. Also, yellow corn, the grains shrink up a little bit more.

It doesn't carry the high carbon content. Therefore, the volume will weigh a pound or two more per bushel, but yet be more deficient in mineral in that bushel than the bushel of yellow corn. Now that's the only exception, just about that I know, where there can be a small deficiency in mineral and an increase in weight.

But most of the time, any increase in weight and carbohydrates means an increase carbohydrate. An increase in carbohydrate generally means an increase in our weight. Now, if you bring your yellow corn to the maximum of its carbohydrate and the same percentage, then it will weigh less than the white corn.

Now also remember, I'm speaking at the same percent of moisture. Please, I forgot to tell you. I'm talking about at the same percent of moisture. However, the white corn at 40% moisture will be about as dry as yellow corn is at 18% or 14% moisture and it will keep much better.

And offered to an animal, they will always take the one that's highest in carbohydrate. Now they don't know anything about laboratory experiments but they can smell the sugar in whatever you're offering them to eat and that's what they will govern their choice of food by.

So in the last few years and people, come up with kinesiology. Well, that's what an animal uses with his nose to tell which is best without using the kinesiology. So whenever we begin to offer food to animals now, many times in your young stock, not much for chicken, but for young animals, young horses, horses are especially sensitive, When they're not doing so well, if you can give them a choice of food, they will correct their own diet.

But when there is no choice, they cannot correct their own diet. They cannot change it and therefore they have to take what they can get. Also, when animals are ill, if they are in open range, will generally go out and eat the herb that they need to get them well again.

But in pens, they cannot do that. There needs to be a lot of research done more on various herbs and plants with animals with certain symptoms in order to find a simple organic natural way of getting them well.

When I grew up with animals, my father had approximately 200 head of cattle. I can't ever remember him having at any time a veterinarian out to any of the cattle because they were in open range. I do remember him having them out once or twice to horses, but they died anyway.

So it didn't make a lot of difference. He had the funeral and the vet bill to pay. But then at that time vets had very little to deal with as compared with what they had today. In later years, my father told me that in his opinion that the animals had been poisoned because of somebody's jealousy.

In other words, someone get mad with you about something, and probably you didn't even know they were mad. Then someone went to an arsenic in your horse trough, and three days later, you had a dead horse or a dead new dead cow.

And all of them died very similar, so it was impossible for a vet to save them anyway. But I'm not casting any reflection on vets. Was just telling you what happened when animals have an open range. Today it's impossible to have an open range, so we're going to have to try to find ways and means to solve our problems within the means of what we have.

And where do you think the problem of farming starts today? I'm going to ask the class this question. Where does the problem of farming begin today? Yes. In the soil. In the soil. That's right. It absolutely begins in the soil.

Right in the soil. Now, if it begins in the soil, I am to ask you another question. Why is it that only one animal will get sick and all the rest of them won't? Or why is it that two percent or five percent get sick and all of them got the same thing? Why is it that just one animal will get sick and all have the same treatment? Can't anybody answer that question? What's that? They're all different.

They're all different, but there's one thing that's different about them, and what is that? I forgot what I told you five minutes ago. What is different about them? The micronage is different. Right? So a slight difference in the micronage down to the millimicronage.

It's actually the millimetomicronage that is different. That's my joke. It's the millimetomicrons that's different. So there's a genetic difference. So therefore, they're going to need a mineral that is different.

Now where and what element does this deficiency first begin in this animal? What one element does it first begin that they get out of the field? What element? Calcium. Calcium, right. Why is calcium so vastly important in an animal, in our food? Why is it so important? And make 60% of the driveway, yes, up to 80%.

Yeah. But there's another reason why. The what is the primary reason? The way the vitamins are most needed. It's where vitamins are most needed, but what manufactures the vitamins? The liver manufactures the vitamins.

That's right. What is the substance of that animals and people's liver manufactures? What's the name of it? Bile. What is bile? Bile is a dilute form of hydrochloric acid. Well, is hydrochloric acid a base or an acid? Is it? I know what the book says, but is it? Don't you know? It is a base.

Hydrochloric acid is a base. Well, for instance, if you dilute hydrochloric acid with distilled water and it's a base, the water being a neutral, then the hydrochloric had to be a base. How do you tell a base from an acid? What distinguishes the difference between a base and an acid? The direction of the rotation of the electron in orbit.

That makes the difference. Now, what determines frequency? Yes, the number, how many times, but what goes around? What determines frequency? Your synchronization point. Your synchronization point determines the frequency.

Is there anything hard about this? Isn't it easy? Well, for instance, if you took sulfuric acid, mixed it with water, what happens? It heats up, doesn't it? And if you have equal amounts by weight, you have hydrogen peroxide, two h two o. Right? So whenever the hydrogen peroxide isn't hot, is it? It has a temperature of the room in which it is.

So that is the synchronization point. At the point that they blend perfectly. At the blending point. I'll say it that way. It's the point at which they blend until there's no more resistance. Now when God made the kinds, he made them on frequencies.

It sounds like I'm back in devotion again, but actually it's it's facts. He made them each according to his own kind, and he told them to go and multiply. Each according to their own frequency, they produced their own kinds.

Now who was the first man that learned something about animal husbandry, the effects of breeding animals, who was the first man that learned? Jacob. What did he learn? Speckled calves. That's right. He got speckled calves.

So therefore, he castrated all the solid kind of the bulls and only used the speckled kind and beat his father as one Jew beating another Jew at his own game because he didn't know anything about Isaac didn't know anything about the breeding of animals, but Jacob did. Was, just as a matter of interest, was Jacob's first wife's name? Leah.

That's right. What was his second wife? How many years did he work for her? Fourteen. Well, I imagine that he paid for her on an installment plan. I don't imagine he had to wait fourteen years to get it. He bought it and paid it for an installment plan until he got it.

These are just interesting facts to kind of wet your mind off of this math for a moment. And now we'll get back to the math. Now what is the frequency of a of a a horse? Can anybody tell me? I'm sorry? 44 for a stunt and 46 for a male.

That's right. What is the frequency of a dog of dogs, wolves, coyotes? Thirty eight and forty. That's correct. Now how many decimals? Four decimals. How many decimals does human beings have? And what's the frequency of human beings? Twenty four and twenty six.

Aren't you glad there's a difference? Well, you see, this is putting things down to where you can handle them and you know what to do about it. Now, if you have any thing with four decimals, it does not require cooked food for its existence.

Now isn't that easy? It can live off of natural foods. Now any human being that tries to live off of uncooked foods is trying to be an animal. And it won't be long before they look like one. You know, I heard it said that they could feed any jackass on raw food.

Well, so if you can't take your problem and smile about them, it gets you down. Your B3 will get too short or you'll lose the ability to smile. Let me ask how many of you farmers, I want to see your hands on this, both men and women, sing while you work.

Hold up your hand. Yeah. Whistle counts. Well, that's pretty good. That's above the average. You got above that. Most of them don't. Well, why don't you sing? Why don't people sing more? Why don't you sing? Do you ever did you ever stop to analyze why you don't sing? You're unhappy.

Happy people sing. So you're unhappy. Well, why are you unhappy? Figure that one out yourself. You don't have to answer in your class. But this is coming down to the base of your problem. In other words, what I am trying to get you to do right now at this time is to learn to define your problem and know what your problem is.

If you don't know what your problem is, there's no way to solve it. There's no way to solve it unless you bound your problem. But once your problem is bounded, then you can start to work on it. And if you're too lazy to think, well, hire somebody to think for you that does not have a product to sell.

If they got a product to sell and you've got a problem run for your life. Okay? Now, some of you may have products to sell. Well, God bless you. But try to help the farmer in such a way that he can buy more of it instead of less of it each year.

In other words, his ability to purchase your product depends on his net profit. So try to help him make a profit first and get yours second, because that's the way to do it. If you really know what you're doing, quit selling any product and get out and sell a service, sell a service without anything attached.

And you will find that if you turn out the goods that you will have more work than any one human being can ever do in their life. Now, also, when you know you know, then you can when you know you know, you should know what you're worth.
