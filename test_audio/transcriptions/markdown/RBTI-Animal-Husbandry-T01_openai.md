I'd like to welcome all of you to a course that I have not had, so we're all going to be together and uh this is a totally new avenue of this continuing series of the biological theory of ionisation. And uh the reason I'm having this course, he's told me enough things, and he's taking my grey matter that he told me if I had have a course he'd finish.

So I'm waiting for the finish and lot of things he's told me and uh So we got kind of an outline I'm going to have typed up here and we'll pass out on what he's going to kind of cover. And then tonight and tomorrow night I'll have about uh an hour and a half, two hours of uh one of the things I want to cover real thoroughly with you is what our on dairy calves, calf problems, scours, health problems and this type thing.

I'm real fortunate in this area I have three thousand payo calves that are shipped in here every winter. And I get a pretty good education. I'll keep him alive, and uh you that there's some you cannot keep alive, and I'll tell you why.

And so I'll be covering some of that and then Dr. Eames will be going into his aspects from the biological theory of ionization which is those of you who've have the soils course, he'll be relating that to the how it effects the animal in quite a little detail.

And also give you some tips and things that we can do in the interim here. But the one thing I want you to do remember when he's lecturing and this type of thing is that Dr. Eames thinks of mathematics and for some of you that may be hard to understand.

And when he gets a thought pattern going uh for the benefit of most of us in the room is to try to refrain from your questions until that thought pattern is done because otherwise he gets off that and it's hard for him to get back on. specific pattern now we're not trying to discourage questions don't get me wrong but there is times that it's easier from letting finish that and then come back with a question now when a question comes up under that kind of a circumstance it'd be best if you could write it down and it would help you greatly then we can pick them up at a different time but I think this would be the most helpful from that standpoint when these things do come to mind Now, a few other things uh the uh there will be cassette tapes taped here and we'll try to get the questions and the answers as best we can.

I realise at times things go on with it, it doesn't always happen, but we'll try to try to do it and if you're catching us we're not doing it often, get after us about it, 'cause we get going on up here and and sometimes we slip up on that and uh the tapes that I have there are a 60 minute tape. I buy the the highest quality tape I can buy.

They're not cheap tapes. And they're four dollars a piece up here. You're welcome to go ahead and record them yourself. I've always said in these courses as long as it doesn't interfere and make a lot of commotion and noise, now try to use your best discretion, please, uh on that.

Uh and on Wednesday night we're gonna have a banquet when Dr. Eames teaches courses this thing he likes to have a banquet. So that'll be on Wednesday night. Uh just come and we'll uh announce that later anyway, there's no charge for that, that'll be put the course here.

So that by uh Dr Eames will start and each morning he likes to have a short devotional and then we'll go on. Is Dr Scout still getting a buzz in this thing? Does it make a difference? Yeah, well, she's clear now.

Okay, that's what it is. That's the one of them spliced ones in. That's alright, the one mic will work, just as long as you can hear it on there, it doesn't want to beat you. Alright. Okay. Good Good morning.

Good morning, everyone. This morning, in our morning devotion, we're going to talk to you about a book. The first thought comes in your mind is the Bible. Well, that's one book, but there's a lot of others.

And most of you, most of your fellows were born in.. There was television brought up with it. Well when I was born we didn't have television and we had more time for books and we didn't watch television so much and we had more time to watch the girls.

So youth is youth at any time. Not a lot of difference in our.. Raised, but there is difference in how we plan our time. And the Bible is a book that limits, that is limited by time. In other words, it really begins with time and ends with time.

But the thoughts in it lead us to a perpetual destiny. Not the book itself, but the thoughts that are in it that we can make a part of ourselves, if every one of us or each one of us was limited by a book, progress would almost cease.

It's only that effort I honor that actual wisdom that's your years beyond the knowledge of the book that really counts. If you're just going to be a teacher, go by the book. But if you're going to be a progressive farmer, then go beyond the book.

Along about 1937. About two o'clock in the morning I got a call to a poultry farm about 40 miles away and I went out to this poultry farm and got there about four o'clock and this man had been in the candy business all the days of his life and he was up in his early 70s and he had gone in the poultry business and the most After the standard poultry farm, I guess in the States, they had conveyor belts for feed, conveyor belts for taking out the manures, and it was really a fabulous poultry farm with boilers is what he was going to produce.

And he had 75,000 baby chicks come in the same day. 25,000 churches and him brand new never raised chicken in his life and three days later there was a February morning the humidity dropped and the temperature was 85 poultry houses and the chicks were dying by the bucketful and when I got there there was a pile of Baby chicks like you can't believe, and baby turkeys, we have two or three colored men going through picking out the dead ones, and the chicks were all huddled in one corner making a noise as if they were cold.

We had two feed men out there and one man from the university who lived near there who was supposed to be a specialist in poultry, had been there since about ten o'clock that night. especially some poetry from the university.

When I got out there, the assembly told me that the chicks were poisoning on something and to bring my emergency kit for poisoning. I brought it alright, but I walked down through the poetry houses from end to end and looked at them and the first question I asked is where I couldn't see any thermostats in the building.

So I said where are your thermostats? And there was in a building outside where you could set one place, set the thermostat in any building so it took me out to where the thermostats were and I turned each one up to 100. They said, you're going to cook these chickens.

I said, you can't eat them raw. Well, there was a case that the.. They're ready to have dropped, and the check's referencing to that at 85 degrees. And in two hours, they said, well, aren't you going to test the water in the field? I said, no.

You called me out here to fix it. I've already fixed it. And I said, in two hours, there won't be any more ticks dying. And they were not. They said, well, there's nothing in the book about that. I said, if they had, you wouldn't have called me.

But I guarantee you this, it'll be tomorrow. It'll be in the book tomorrow. So this is what I'm telling you. Go beyond the book. Dare to go beyond the book. Use that head. There's a knot on everybody's shoulder here, and in it is supposed to be some brains, and use them.

Go beyond the book. Don't try to be limited by the book unless you're a professor, and then present more than one way of doing a thing. When I was in college, I only presented one way to do it. I've spent 50 years in research and I found as many ways to prosperity and also to this poorhouse.

Go buy your problems. In other words, you don't need a book to have a problem, and then you need to refresh your memory on what has been done about that problem, and if none of the things that's been done on that problem, then do the next best thing, and that then is beginning to solve your problem.

As to go beyond the book, now, where do you start when you go beyond the book? And that is to see everything you look at. You know, most people go through life and they see very little. In the agriculture class, I asked the class how many people knew which way.

To see that a watermelon pointed to the rind or to the heart, and then I think there's only two or three in the class that do, they don't see everything you look at. Close attention to everything you see registered in your mind, and then you can..

For them to collect points in solving your problem. But one thing I advise you never to do is never to take your problems to bed with you unless it is a female. Don't take your farm problems to bed with you.

Your domestic problem, yes. So.. This week we're going to learn things that are not in the book. And you're going to also learn that the books are for one purpose, and that is to get you to thinking. Now, if you are in a mechanical school, then you would go by the book, but you're not dealing with a mechanical object.

You are dealing with a biological life. Where there isn't any real pattern of perfection as far as putting or taking apart the parts like an automobile. There's no car keys. There's no nuts except the one that's trying to solve the problem.

And you can be a part of the answer instead of a part of the problem. The farmer tomorrow of tomorrow and the minister of the gospel of tomorrow that is most successful is going to be the one. That those their own thinking collects their own prejudices and sets a precedent for themselves and keep their mouths shut about how they made their progress because they will find the thing that worked for you does not work for your neighbor always.

And sometimes it does, once in a while. Down in Georgia, there was a friend called up his friend Jed and said, Jed said, when your mule was sick, what did you do for him? Jed said, I gave him a quart of turpentine.

So Jim met him on the street on Saturday night, and Jim said, how's your mule? He said, I caught a turpentine and killed him. And Jim said, it killed my mule too. So sometimes with your remedies, you need to find out what the result is before you apply the remedy.

So what I'm trying to say is let's put some horse sense behind our farming. practices behind our religion and works. In regard to our morning devotion this morning I want to leave you one main thought. I find when I leave over three we forget all of them.

But if I just leave you one or two you'll remember them and can take them home with you and that is that duty to God or service to God begins where duty ends. Service to God begins where duty ends. Don't forget that, because as long as you're doing your duty, that's not service for God.

So you must go beyond duty in order to be of value, and it's only that part of your life that you go beyond duty that pays high dividends. And I'll tell you how high it will pay. Then your paycheck becomes, or your net profit becomes, God's report card.

When we're in school, we work for a grade, but when we're in life, we work for remuneration of some kind. But then your paycheck is God's report card, how well pleased he is with you. And I give you a verse of scripture now from my second thought on the scripture this morning, and this one you will find in the Amos, the book of Amos, the third chapter and the seventh verse.

In the King James Version it says this, I will not, the Lord is speaking to Amos, and he said this, I will not do anything. Except that which I will reveal to my prophets. Some of the translations is italics if they ask me, which is understood without the italics.

So one of the things to do in farming when all biological life is depending upon God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The meditation with you is to ask them what you don't know the answer to. That's where I got my answers.

And I don't have them all. I just have a few of them that works. And we're going to learn about those answers or some of those things this week. But go beyond the book. Even in your spiritual life, go beyond the book.

Go to the point that when Jesus said, My sheep know my voice, go until you hear his voice. In order to hear his voice, you're going to have to turn off the television for a few hours, the radio, or the hum of the tractor.

You're going to have to listen. And there's no time better in life to listen. in the night when you are awake and the more awake you are at night the healthier you are the don't need the rest no one has ever died from lack of sleep but the cemetery is full of people who died from worrying about it when you're ill and sick Or if you're dead tired at night, if you're dead tired at night, you're sick.

But if you've got a lot of energy in the evening, your reserve energy is higher. So take care of your health and then you can think straight. Sick people can't think straight. So then also you're going to find it's the same thing in biological life.

That keeps you thinking straight and all of that and as well as theological life, you've got to be able to have the right words to think straight. I believe, thoroughly believe that the farmers of tomorrow can be our nation's finest doctors and that many of them will be.

They produce a high quality food, and they know what they have, and they know how to market it, and that's what we're going to study about this week, is how to have a higher quality food at lower costs per package, and get a premium price in the market. I'll give you an example.

Right now in Boston, we are paying up to 50 cents a piece for little grapefruit. And the farmer in Florida is getting a dollar for two bushels, a hundred grade fruit. Just think of that. Just think of it.

Well, there's a lot of, there's too much loss between the farmer and the retail market. Now, a year ago, In Boston, around about over the United States, we were paying $7, around $7.50 to $8 at this time of year, end of January, for lemons.

We're paying $22.50 now for the same box of lemons. Not because they had a short crop, but because a lot of people are making lemonade. A lot of people have become more in demand, and there are going to be more demand.

So supply and demand is what causes prices to go up, but also remember this, that the market has never been flooded with top-quality produce. There's always a great demand for top-quality produce. And they know the church has never been flooded with real saints of God.

Real saints of God, whose faith is backed up by works. Faith without works is dead. And by their fruits ye shall know them. A saint of God is a peculiar person. In that, it is impossible to insult one, they're insult proof, they are so busy attending to God's business until they don't have time to tend to the neighbor's business, and consequently they have a good report card and have a good paycheck.

Also, the person is so busy in the church attending to other people's business. Uh, don't have very much fruit, and to criticize everybody else's. But remember this, as farmers, as men in a community, as a part of our government, it's a lot, it takes a lot less energy to push anyone up than it does to push them down.

Because when you're pushing down they're going to resist it and I've never seen a man resist being pushed up Also, it takes twice as much energy to get up after you're going down with them as It were to push them up in the first place so Conserve our energy everything we say everything we do depends on energy of some kind Our lives as what we are depends on spiritual energy. Our progress in the farm depends on spiritual energy.

The crop grows on a life given from God. You can't put life in a seed. You can't put life in a hill of grass. You can't put life in a hit of corn, but God can. So start giving him the credit and blame me. He gave you the cash.

It's not a fair trade.
